Introduction \\n \\n1.1 What Is Machine Learning?  \\nMachine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example \\ndata or past experience. We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the \\nexecution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or \\npast experience. The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or descriptive to gain \\nknowledge from data, or both. \\nArthur Samuel, an early American leader in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, \\ncoined the term “Machine Learning” in 1959 while at IBM. He defined machine learning as “the field of \\nstudy that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” However, there is \\nno universally accepted definition for machine learning. Different authors define the term differently. \\n \\nDefinition of learning \\nDefinition \\nA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and \\nperformance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. \\n \\nExamples \\ni) Handwriting recognition learning problem \\n• Task T: Recognising and classifying handwritten words within images \\n• Performance P: Percent of words correctly classified \\n• Training experience E: A dataset of handwritten words with given classifications \\nii) A robot driving learning problem \\n• Task T: Driving on highways using vision sensors \\n• Performance measure P: Average distance traveled before an error \\n• training experience: A sequence of images and steering commands recorded while  \\n  observing a human driver \\niii) A chess learning problem \\n• Task T: Playing chess \\n• Performance measure P: Percent of games won against opponents \\n• Training experience E: Playing practice games against itself \\nDefinition \\nA computer program which learns from experience is called a machine learning program or \\nsimply a learning program. Such a program is sometimes also referred to as a learner. \\n \\n1.2 Components of Learning \\n Basic components of learning process \\nThe learning process, whether by a human or a machine, can be divided into four components, \\nnamely, data storage, abstraction, generalization and evaluation. Figure 1.1 illustrates the \\nvariouscomponents and the steps involved in the learning process.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 6}, page_content='2 \\n \\n \\n1. Data storage \\nFacilities for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data are an important component of the \\nlearning process. Humans and computers alike utilize data storage as a foundation for advanced \\nreasoning. \\n• In a human being, the data is stored in the brain and data is retrieved using electrochemical    signals. \\n• Computers use hard disk drives, flash memory, random access memory and similar devices    to store \\ndata and use cables and other technology to retrieve data. \\n \\n2. Abstraction \\nThe second component of the learning process is known as abstraction. \\nAbstraction is the process of extracting knowledge about stored data. This involves creating general \\nconcepts about the data as a whole. The creation of knowledge involves application of known models \\nand creation of new models. \\nThe process of fitting a model to a dataset is known as training. When the model has been trained, the \\ndata is transformed into an abstract form that summarizes the original information. \\n \\n3. Generalization \\nThe third component of the learning process is known as generalisation. \\nThe term generalization describes the process of turning the knowledge about stored data into a form \\nthat can be utilized for future action. These actions are to be carried out on tasks that are similar, but \\nnot identical, to those what have been seen before. In generalization, the goal is to discover those \\nproperties of the data that will be most relevant to future tasks. \\n \\n4. Evaluation \\nEvaluation is the last component of the learning process. \\nIt is the process of giving feedback to the user to measure the utility of the learned knowledge. This \\nfeedback is then utilised to effect improvements in the whole learning process \\n \\nApplications of machine learning \\nApplication of machine learning methods to large databases is called data mining. In data \\nmining, a large volume of data is processed to construct a simple model with valuable use, for example, \\nhaving \\nhigh predictive accuracy. \\n \\nThe following is a list of some of the typical applications of machine learning. \\n1. In retail business, machine learning is used to study consumer behaviour. \\n2. In finance, banks analyze their past data to build models to use in credit applications, fraud \\ndetection, and the stock market. \\n3. In manufacturing, learning models are used for optimization, control, and troubleshooting.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 7}, page_content='3 \\n \\n4. In medicine, learning programs are used for medical diagnosis. \\n5. In telecommunications, call patterns are analyzed for network optimization and maximizing the \\nquality of service. \\n6. In science, large amounts of data in physics, astronomy, and biology can only be analyzed fast \\nenough by computers. The World Wide Web is huge; it is constantly growing and searching for \\nrelevant information cannot be done manually. \\n7. In artificial intelligence, it is used to teach a system to learn and adapt to changes so that the \\nsystem designer need not foresee and provide solutions for all possible situations.  \\n8. It is used to find solutions to many problems in vision, speech recognition, and robotics.  \\n9. Machine learning methods are applied in the design of computer-controlled vehicles to steer \\ncorrectly when driving on a variety of roads. \\n10. Machine learning methods have been used to develop programmes for playing games such as \\nchess, backgammon and Go. \\n \\n1.3 Learning Models \\nMachine learning is concerned with using the right features to build the right models that \\nachieve the right tasks.  The basic idea of Learning models has divided into three categories. \\nFor a given problem, the collection of all possible outcomes represents the sample space or instance \\nspace. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing a Logical expression. (Logical models) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing the Geometry of the instance space. (Geometric models)  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing Probability to classify the instance space. (Probabilistic models) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGrouping and Grading \\n \\n1.3.1  Logical models \\nLogical models use a logical expression to divide the instance space into segments and hence \\nconstruct grouping models. A logical expression is an expression that returns a Boolean value, i.e., a \\nTrue or False outcome. Once the data is grouped using a logical expression, the data is divided into \\nhomogeneous groupings for the problem we are trying to solve.  For example, for a classiﬁcation \\nproblem, all the instances in the group belong to one class. \\n \\nThere are mainly two kinds of logical models: Tree models and Rule models. \\n \\nRule models consist of a collection of implications or IF-THEN rules. For tree-based models, the ‘if-part’ \\ndeﬁnes a segment and the ‘then-part’ deﬁnes the behaviour of the model for this segment. Rule models \\nfollow the same reasoning. \\n \\nLogical models and Concept learning \\nTo understand logical models further, we need to understand the idea of Concept Learning. \\nConcept Learning involves learning logical expressions or concepts from examples. The idea of Concept \\nLearning fits in well with the idea of Machine learning, i.e., inferring a general function from specific \\ntraining examples. Concept learning forms the basis of both tree-based and rule-based models.  More \\nformally, Concept Learning involves acquiring the definition of a general category from a given set of \\npositive and negative training examples of the category. A Formal Definition for Concept Learning is \\n“The inferring of a Boolean-valued function from training examples of its input and output.” In \\nconcept learning, we only learn a description for the positive class and label everything that doesn’t \\nsatisfy that description as negative.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 8}, page_content='4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe following example explains this idea in more detail. \\n \\n \\n \\nA Concept Learning Task called “Enjoy Sport” as shown above is defined by a set of data from \\nsome example days. Each data is described by six attributes. The task is to learn to predict the value of \\nEnjoy Sport for an arbitrary day based on the values of its attribute values. The problem can be \\nrepresented by a series of hypotheses. Each hypothesis is described by a conjunction of constraints on \\nthe attributes. The training data represents a set of positive and negative examples of the target \\nfunction. In the example above, each hypothesis is a vector of six constraints, specifying the values of \\nthe six attributes –  Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. The training phase involves \\nlearning the set of days (as a conjunction of attributes) for which Enjoy Sport = yes. \\n \\nThus, the problem can be formulated as: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGiven instances X  which represent a set of all possible days, each described by the attributes: \\no \\nSky – (values: Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy), \\no \\nAirTemp – (values: Warm, Cold), \\no \\nHumidity – (values: Normal, High), \\no \\nWind – (values: Strong, Weak), \\no \\nWater – (values: Warm, Cold), \\no \\nForecast – (values: Same, Change). \\n \\nTry to identify a function that can predict the target variable Enjoy Sport as yes/no, i.e., 1 or 0. \\n \\n1.3.2 Geometric models \\nIn the previous section, we have seen that with logical models, such as decision trees, a logical \\nexpression is used to partition the instance space. Two instances are similar when they end up in the \\nsame logical segment. In this section, we consider models that define similarity by considering the \\ngeometry of the instance space.  In Geometric models, features could be described as points in two \\ndimensions (x- and y-axis) or a three-dimensional space (x, y, and z). Even when features are not'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 9}, page_content='5 \\n \\nintrinsically geometric, they could be modelled in a geometric manner (for example, temperature as a \\nfunction of time can be modelled in two axes). In geometric models, there are two ways we could \\nimpose similarity. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWe could use geometric concepts like lines or planes to segment (classify) the instance space. \\nThese are called Linear models. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAlternatively, we can use the geometric notion of distance to represent similarity. In this case, if \\ntwo points are close together, they have similar values for features and thus can be classed as \\nsimilar. We call such models as Distance-based models. \\n \\n \\nLinear models \\nLinear models are relatively simple. In this case, the function is represented as a linear \\ncombination of its inputs. Thus, if x1 and x2 are two scalars or vectors of the same dimension \\nand a and b are arbitrary scalars, then ax1 + bx2 represents a linear combination of x1 and x2. In the \\nsimplest case where f(x) represents a straight line, we have an equation of the form f (x) \\n= mx + c where c represents the intercept and m represents the slope. \\n \\n \\nLinear models are parametric, which means that they have a ﬁxed form with a small number of numeric \\nparameters that need to be learned from data. For example, in f (x) = mx + c, m and c are the \\nparameters that we are trying to learn from the data. This technique is different from tree or rule \\nmodels, where the structure of the model (e.g., which features to use in the tree, and where) is not \\nﬁxed in advance. \\n \\nLinear models are stable, i.e., small variations in the training data have only a limited impact on the \\nlearned model. In contrast, tree models tend to vary more with the training data, as the choice of a \\ndifferent split at the root of the tree typically means that the rest of the tree is different as well.  As a \\nresult of having relatively few parameters, Linear models have low variance and high bias. This implies \\nthat Linear models are less likely to overfit the training data than some other models. However, they \\nare more likely to underfit. For example, if we want to learn the boundaries between countries based \\non labelled data, then linear models are not likely to give a good approximation. \\n \\nDistance-based models \\nDistance-based models are the second class of Geometric models. Like Linear models, distance-\\nbased models are based on the geometry of data. As the name implies, distance-based models work on \\nthe concept of distance.  In the context of Machine learning, the concept of distance is not based on \\nmerely the physical distance between two points. Instead, we could think of the distance between two \\npoints considering the mode of transport between two points. Travelling between two cities by plane'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 10}, page_content='6 \\n \\ncovers less distance physically than by train because a plane is unrestricted. Similarly, in chess, the \\nconcept of distance depends on the piece used – for example, a Bishop can move diagonally.   Thus, \\ndepending on the entity and the mode of travel, the concept of distance can be experienced differently. \\nThe distance metrics commonly used are Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, and Mahalanobis. \\n \\n \\nDistance is applied through the concept of neighbours and exemplars. Neighbours are points in \\nproximity with respect to the distance measure expressed through exemplars. Exemplars are \\neither centroids that ﬁnd a centre of mass according to a chosen distance metric or medoids that ﬁnd \\nthe most centrally located data point. The most commonly used centroid is the arithmetic mean, which \\nminimises squared Euclidean distance to all other points. \\n \\nNotes: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe centroid represents the geometric centre of a plane figure, i.e., the arithmetic mean \\nposition of all the points in the figure from the centroid point. This definition extends to any \\nobject in n-dimensional space: its centroid is the mean position of all the points. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nMedoids are similar in concept to means or centroids. Medoids are most commonly used on \\ndata when a mean or centroid cannot be defined. They are used in contexts where the centroid \\nis not representative of the dataset, such as in image data. \\n \\nExamples of distance-based models include the nearest-neighbour models, which use the training data \\nas exemplars – for example, in classification. The K-means clustering algorithm also uses exemplars to \\ncreate clusters of similar data points. \\n \\n1.3.3 Probabilistic models \\nThe third family of machine learning algorithms is the probabilistic models. We have seen \\nbefore that the k-nearest neighbour algorithm uses the idea of distance (e.g., Euclidian distance) to \\nclassify entities, and logical models use a logical expression to partition the instance space. In this \\nsection, we see how the probabilistic models use the idea of probability to classify new entities. \\n \\nProbabilistic models see features and target variables as random variables. The process of modelling \\nrepresents and manipulates the level of uncertainty with respect to these variables. There are two \\ntypes of probabilistic models: Predictive and Generative. Predictive probability models use the idea of \\na conditional probability distribution P (Y |X) from which Y can be predicted from X.  Generative models \\nestimate the joint distribution P (Y, X).  Once we know the joint distribution for the generative models, \\nwe can derive any conditional or marginal distribution involving the same variables. Thus, the \\ngenerative model is capable of creating new data points and their labels, knowing the joint probability \\ndistribution. The joint distribution looks for a relationship between two variables. Once this relationship \\nis inferred, it is possible to infer new data points. \\nNaïve Bayes is an example of a probabilistic classifier. \\n \\nWe can do this using the Bayes rule defined as'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 11}, page_content='7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Naïve Bayes algorithm is based on the idea of Conditional Probability.  Conditional probability is \\nbased on finding the probability that something will happen, given that something else has already \\nhappened. The task of the algorithm then is to look at the evidence and to determine the likelihood of a \\nspecific class and assign a label accordingly to each entity. \\n \\nSome broad categories of models: \\nGeometric models \\nProbabilistic models \\nLogical models \\nE.g. K-nearest neighbors, linear \\nregression, \\nsupport \\nvector \\nmachine, logistic regression, … \\nNaïve Bayes, Gaussian process \\nregression, conditional random \\nfield, … \\nDecision tree, random forest, … \\n \\n1.3.4 Grouping and Grading \\nGrading vs grouping is an orthogonal categorization to geometric-probabilistic-logical-compositional.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGrouping models break the instance space up into groups or segments and in each segment \\napply a very simple method (such as majority class). \\no E.g. decision tree, KNN. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGrading models form one global model over the instance space. \\no E.g. Linear classifiers – Neural networks \\n1.4 Designing a Learning System \\nFor any learning system, we must be knowing the three elements — T (Task), P (Performance \\nMeasure), and E (Training Experience). At a high level, the process of learning system looks as below. \\n \\nThe learning process starts with task T, performance measure P and training experience E and objective \\nare to find an unknown target function. The target function is an exact knowledge to be learned from the \\ntraining experience and its unknown. For example, in a case of credit approval, the learning system will \\nhave customer application records as experience and task would be to classify whether the given \\ncustomer application is eligible for a loan. So in this case, the training examples can be represented as'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 12}, page_content=\"8 \\n \\n(x1,y1)(x2,y2)..(xn,yn) where X represents customer application details and y represents the status of \\ncredit approval. \\nWith these details, what is that exact knowledge to be learned from the training experience? \\nSo the target function to be learned in the credit approval learning system is a mapping function f:X →y. \\nThis function represents the exact knowledge defining the relationship between input variable X and \\noutput variable y.  \\nDesign of a learning system \\nJust now we looked into the learning process and also understood the goal of the learning. When we \\nwant to design a learning system that follows the learning process, we need to consider a few design \\nchoices. The design choices will be to decide the following key components: \\n1. Type of training experience \\n2. Choosing the Target Function \\n3. Choosing a representation for the Target Function \\n4. Choosing an approximation algorithm for the Target Function \\n5. The final Design \\n \\nWe will look into the game - checkers learning problem and apply the above design choices. For a \\ncheckers learning problem, the three elements will be, \\n \\n1. Task T: To play checkers \\n2. Performance measure P: Total percent of the game won in the tournament. \\n3. Training experience E: A set of games played against itself \\n \\n1.4.1 Type of training experience \\nDuring the design of the checker's learning system, the type of training experience available for a \\nlearning system will have a significant effect on the success or failure of the learning. \\n \\n1. Direct or Indirect training experience — In the case of direct training experience, an individual board \\nstates \\nand \\ncorrect \\nmove \\nfor \\neach \\nboard \\nstate \\nare \\ngiven. \\nIn case of indirect training experience, the move sequences for a game and the final result (win, loss \\nor draw) are given for a number of games. How to assign credit or blame to individual moves is the \\ncredit assignment problem. \\n2. Teacher or Not — Supervised — The training experience will be labeled, which means, all the board \\nstates will be labeled with the correct move. So the learning takes place in the presence of a \\nsupervisor \\nor \\na \\nteacher. \\nUnsupervised — The training experience will be unlabeled, which means, all the board states will not \\nhave the moves. So the learner generates random games and plays against itself with no supervision \\nor \\nteacher \\ninvolvement.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 13}, page_content='9 \\n \\nSemi-supervised — Learner generates game states and asks the teacher for help in finding the \\ncorrect move if the board state is confusing. \\n3. Is the training experience good — Do the training examples represent the distribution of examples \\nover which the final system performance will be measured? Performance is best when training \\nexamples and test examples are from the same/a similar distribution. \\n \\nThe checker player learns by playing against oneself. Its experience is indirect. It may not encounter \\nmoves that are common in human expert play. Once the proper training experience is available, the next \\ndesign step will be choosing the Target Function. \\n \\n1.4.2 Choosing the Target Function \\nWhen you are playing the checkers game, at any moment of time, you make a decision on \\nchoosing the best move from different possibilities. You think and apply the learning that you have \\ngained from the experience. Here the learning is, for a specific board, you move a checker such that your \\nboard state tends towards the winning situation. Now the same learning has to be defined in terms of \\nthe target function. \\n \\nHere there are 2 considerations — direct and indirect experience. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDuring the direct experience, the checkers learning system, it needs only to learn how to choose \\nthe best move among some large search space. We need to find a target function that will help \\nus choose the best move among alternatives. Let us call this function ChooseMove and use the \\nnotation ChooseMove : B →M to indicate that this function accepts as input any board from the \\nset of legal board states B and produces as output some move from the set of legal moves M. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhen there is an indirect experience, it becomes difficult to learn such function. How about \\nassigning a real score to the board state.  \\n \\nSo the function be V : B →R indicating that this accepts as input any board from the set of legal board \\nstates B and produces an output a real score. This function assigns the higher scores to better board \\nstates. \\n \\n \\nIf the system can successfully learn such a target function V, then it can easily use it to select the best \\nmove from any board position.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 14}, page_content='10 \\n \\nLet us therefore define the target value V(b) for an arbitrary board state b in B, as follows: \\n1. if b is a final board state that is won, then V(b) = 100 \\n2. if b is a final board state that is lost, then V(b) = -100 \\n3. if b is a final board state that is drawn, then V(b) = 0 \\n4. if b is a not a final state in the game, then V (b) = V (b’), where b’ is the best final board state that can \\nbe achieved starting from b and playing optimally until the end of the game. \\n \\nThe (4) is a recursive definition and to determine the value of V(b) for a particular board state, it \\nperforms the search ahead for the optimal line of play, all the way to the end of the game. So this \\ndefinition is not efficiently computable by our checkers playing program, we say that it is a \\nnonoperational definition. \\n \\nThe goal of learning, in this case, is to discover an operational description of V ; that is, a description \\nthat can be used by the checkers-playing program to evaluate states and select moves within realistic \\ntime bounds. \\nIt may be very difficult in general to learn such an operational form of V perfectly. We expect learning \\nalgorithms to acquire only some approximation to the target function ^V. \\n \\n1.4.3 Choosing a representation for the Target Function \\nNow that we have specified the ideal target function V, we must choose a representation that \\nthe learning program will use to describe the function ^V that it will learn. As with earlier design \\nchoices, we again have many options. We could, for example, allow the program to represent using a \\nlarge table with a distinct entry specifying the value for each distinct board state. Or we could allow it to \\nrepresent using a collection of rules that match against features of the board state, or a quadratic \\npolynomial function of predefined board features, or an artificial \\nneural network. In general, this choice of representation involves a crucial tradeoff. On one hand, we \\nwish to pick a very expressive representation to allow representing as close an approximation as \\npossible to the ideal target function V.  \\n \\nOn the other hand, the more expressive the representation, the more training data the program \\nwill require in order to choose among the alternative hypotheses it can represent. To keep the \\ndiscussion brief, let us choose a simple representation:  \\nfor any given board state, the function ^V will be calculated as a linear combination of the following \\nboard features: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx1(b) — number of black pieces on board b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx2(b) — number of red pieces on b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx3(b) — number of black kings on b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx4(b) — number of red kings on b \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx5(b) — number of red pieces threatened by black (i.e., which can be taken on black’s next turn) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nx6(b) — number of black pieces threatened by red \\n \\n^V = w0 + w1 · x1(b) + w2 · x2(b) + w3 · x3(b) + w4 · x4(b) +w5 · x5(b) + w6 · x6(b) \\n \\nWhere w0 through w6 are numerical coefficients or weights to be obtained by a learning algorithm.  \\nWeights w1 to w6 will determine the relative importance of different board features.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 15}, page_content='11 \\n \\nSpecification of the Machine Learning Problem at this time — Till now we worked on choosing the type \\nof training experience, choosing the target function and its representation. The checkers learning task \\ncan be summarized as below. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTask T : Play Checkers \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPerformance Measure : % of games won in world tournament \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTraining Experience E : opportunity to play against itself \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTarget Function : V : Board → R \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTarget Function Representation : ^V = w0 + w1 · x1(b) + w2 · x2(b) + w3 · x3(b) + w4 · x4(b) +w5 · \\nx5(b) + w6 · x6(b) \\nThe first three items above correspond to the specification of the learning task,whereas the final two \\nitems constitute design choices for the implementation of the learning program. \\n \\n1.4.4 Choosing an approximation algorithm for the Target Function \\nGenerating training data — \\nTo train our learning program, we need a set of training data, each describing a specific board state b and \\nthe training value V_train (b) for b. Each training example is an ordered pair <b,V_train(b)> \\nFor example, a training example may be <(x1 = 3, x2 = 0, x3 = 1, x4 = 0, x5 = 0, x6 = 0), +100\">. This is an \\nexample where black has won the game since x2 = 0 or red has no remaining pieces. However, such clean \\nvalues of V_train (b) can be obtained only for board value b that are clear win, loss or draw. \\nIn above case, assigning a training value V_train(b) for the specific boards b that are clean win, loss or \\ndraw is direct as they are direct training experience. But in the case of indirect training experience, \\nassigning a training value V_train(b) for the intermediate boards is difficult. In such case, the training \\nvalues are updated using temporal difference learning. Temporal difference (TD) learning is a concept \\ncentral to reinforcement learning, in which learning happens through the iterative correction of your \\nestimated returns towards a more accurate target return. \\nLet Successor(b) denotes the next board state following b for which it is again the program’s turn to \\nmove. ^V is the learner’s current approximation to V. Using these information, assign the training value \\nof V_train(b) for any intermediate board state b as below :  \\nV_train(b) ← ^V(Successor(b)) \\n \\nAdjusting the weights \\nNow its time to define the learning algorithm for choosing the weights and best fit the set of \\ntraining examples. One common approach is to define the best hypothesis as that which minimizes the \\nsquared error E between the training values and the values predicted by the hypothesis ^V. \\n \\n \\nThe learning algorithm should incrementally refine weights as more training examples become available \\nand it needs to be robust to errors in training data Least Mean Square (LMS) training rule is the one \\ntraining algorithm that will adjust weights a small amount in the direction that reduces the error. \\n \\nThe LMS algorithm is defined as follows:'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 16}, page_content='12 \\n \\n \\n \\n1.4.5 Final Design for Checkers Learning system \\nThe final design of our checkers learning system can be naturally described by four distinct \\nprogram modules that represent the central components in many learning systems. \\n1. The performance System — Takes a new board as input and outputs a trace of the game it played \\nagainst itself. \\n2. The Critic — Takes the trace of a game as an input and outputs a set of training examples of the \\ntarget function. \\n3. The Generalizer — Takes training examples as input and outputs a hypothesis that estimates the \\ntarget function. Good generalization to new cases is crucial. \\n4. The Experiment Generator — Takes the current hypothesis (currently learned function) as input and \\noutputs a new problem (an initial board state) for the performance system to explore. \\n \\n \\nFinal design of the checkers learning program. \\n \\n1.5 Types of Learning \\nIn general, machine learning algorithms can be classified into three types. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSupervised learning \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUnsupervised learning \\n\\uf0b7 \\nReinforcement learning \\n \\n1.5.1 Supervised learning \\nA training set of examples with the correct responses (targets) is provided and, based on this \\ntraining set, the algorithm generalises to respond correctly to all possible inputs. This is also called \\nlearning from exemplars. Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that \\nmaps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. \\n \\nIn supervised learning, each example in the training set is a pair consisting of an input object \\n(typically a vector) and an output value. A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and \\nproduces a function, which can be used for mapping new examples. In the optimal case, the function \\nwill correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.

A wide range of supervised learning algorithms are \\navailable, each with its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best \\non all supervised learning problems. \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.4: Supervised learning \\n \\n \\n \\nRemarks \\nA “supervised learning” is so called because the process of an algorithm learning from the \\ntraining dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct \\nanswers (that is, the correct outputs), the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data \\nand is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of \\nperformance. \\n \\nExample \\nConsider the following data regarding patients entering a clinic. The data consists of the gender \\nand age of the patients and each patient is labeled as “healthy” or “sick”. \\n \\n \\n \\n1.5.2 Unsupervised learning \\nCorrect responses are not provided, but instead the algorithm tries to identify similarities \\nbetween the inputs so that inputs that have something in common are categorised together. The \\nstatistical approach to unsupervised learning is \\nknown as density estimation. \\n \\nUnsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from \\ndatasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. In unsupervised learning algorithms, a \\nclassification or categorization is not included in the observations. There are no output values and so \\nthere is no estimation of functions. Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, the accuracy \\nof the structure that is output by the algorithm cannot be evaluated. The most common unsupervised \\nlearning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 18}, page_content=\"14 \\n \\nor grouping in data. \\n \\nExample \\nConsider the following data regarding patients entering a clinic. The data consists of the gender \\nand age of the patients. \\n \\nBased on this data, can we infer anything regarding the patients entering the clinic? \\n \\n1.5.3 Reinforcement learning \\nThis is somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning. The algorithm gets told \\nwhen the answer is wrong, but does not get told how to correct it. It has to explore and try out different \\npossibilities until it works out how to get the answer right. Reinforcement learning is sometime called \\nlearning with a critic because of this monitor that scores the answer, but does not suggest \\nimprovements. \\n \\nReinforcement learning is the problem of getting an agent to act in the world so as to maximize \\nits rewards. A learner (the program) is not told what actions to take as in most forms of machine \\nlearning, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most \\ninteresting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next \\nsituations and, through that, all subsequent rewards. \\n \\nExample \\nConsider teaching a dog a new trick: we cannot tell it what to do, but we can reward/punish it if \\nit does the right/wrong thing. It has to find out what it did that made it get the reward/punishment. We \\ncan use a similar method to train computers to do many tasks, such as playing backgammon or chess, \\nscheduling jobs, and controlling robot limbs. Reinforcement learning is different from supervised \\nlearning. Supervised learning is learning from examples provided by a knowledgeable expert. \\n \\n1.6 PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES IN MACHINE LEARNING \\n \\nPerspectives in Machine Learning \\nOne useful perspective on machine learning is that it involves searching a very large space of \\npossible hypotheses to determine one that best fits the observed data and any prior knowledge held by \\nthe learner. \\nFor example, consider the space of hypotheses that could in principle be output by the above checkers \\nlearner. This hypothesis space consists of all evaluation functions that can be represented by some \\nchoice of values for the weights wo through w6. The learner's task is thus to search through this vast \\nspace to locate the hypothesis that is most consistent with the available training examples. The LMS \\nalgorithm for fitting weights achieves this goal by iteratively tuning the weights, adding a correction to \\neach weight each time the hypothesized evaluation function predicts a value that differs from the \\ntraining value. This algorithm works well when the hypothesis representation considered by the learner \\ndefines a continuously parameterized space of potential hypotheses.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 19}, page_content=\"15 \\n \\nMany of the chapters in this book present algorithms that search a hypothesis space defined by \\nsome underlying representation (e.g., linear functions, logical descriptions, decision trees, artificial \\nneural networks). These different hypothesis representations are appropriate for learning different \\nkinds of target functions. For each of these hypothesis representations, the corresponding learning \\nalgorithm takes advantage of a different underlying structure to organize the search through the \\nhypothesis space.  \\n \\nThroughout this book we will return to this perspective of learning as a search problem in order \\nto characterize learning methods by their search strategies and by the underlying structure of the \\nsearch spaces they explore. We will also find this viewpoint useful in formally analyzing the relationship \\nbetween the size of the hypothesis space to be searched, the number of training examples available, \\nand the confidence we can have that a hypothesis consistent with the training data will correctly \\ngeneralize to unseen examples. \\n \\nIssues in Machine Learning \\nOur checkers example raises a number of generic questions about machine learning. The field of \\nmachine learning, and much of this book, is concerned with answering questions such as the following: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhat algorithms exist for learning general target functions from specific training examples? In \\nwhat settings will particular algorithms converge to the desired function, given sufficient \\ntraining data? Which algorithms perform best for which types of problems and representations? \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHow much training data is sufficient? What general bounds can be found to relate the \\nconfidence in learned hypotheses to the amount of training experience and the character of the \\nlearner's hypothesis space? \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhen and how can prior knowledge held by the learner guide the process of generalizing from \\nexamples? Can prior knowledge be helpful even when it is only approximately correct? \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhat is the best strategy for choosing a useful next training experience, and how does the \\nchoice of this strategy alter the complexity of the learning problem?  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhat is the best way to reduce the learning task to one or more function approximation \\nproblems? Put another way, what specific functions should the system attempt to learn? Can \\nthis process itself be automated?  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHow can the learner automatically alter its representation to improve its ability to represent \\nand learn the target function? \\n \\n1.7 Version Spaces \\nDefinition (Version space). A concept is complete if it covers all positive examples. \\n \\nA concept is consistent if it covers none of the negative examples. The version space is the set of all \\ncomplete and consistent concepts. This set is convex and is fully defined by its least and most general \\nelements. \\n \\nThe key idea in the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm is to output a description of the set of all \\nhypotheses consistent with the training examples \\n \\n1.7.1 Representation \\nThe Candidate – Elimination  algorithm finds all describable hypotheses that are consistent with the\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 20}, page_content=\"16 \\n \\nobserved training examples. In order to define this algorithm precisely, we begin with a few basic \\ndefinitions.

Decision Tree \\nIntroduction Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning (that is you explain what \\nthe input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data) where the data is continuously \\nsplit according to a certain parameter. The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision \\nnodes and leaves. The leaves are the decisions or the final outcomes. And the decision nodes are where \\nthe data is split. \\n \\nAn example of a decision tree can be explained using above binary tree. Let’s say you want to predict \\nwhether a person is fit given their information like age, eating habit, and physical activity, etc. The'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 29}, page_content='25 \\n \\ndecision nodes here are questions like ‘What’s the age?’, ‘Does he exercise?’, and ‘Does he eat a lot of \\npizzas’? And the leaves, which are outcomes like either ‘fit’, or ‘unfit’. In this case this was a binary \\nclassification problem (a yes no type problem). There are two main types of Decision Trees: \\n1. Classification trees (Yes/No types) \\nWhat we have seen above is an example of classification tree, where the outcome was a variable like \\n‘fit’ or ‘unfit’. Here the decision variable is Categorical. \\n \\n2. Regression trees (Continuous data types) \\nHere the decision or the outcome variable is Continuous, e.g. a number like 123.  Working Now that we \\nknow what a Decision Tree is, we’ll see how it works internally. There are many algorithms out there \\nwhich construct Decision Trees, but one of the best is called as ID3 Algorithm. ID3 Stands for Iterative \\nDichotomiser 3. Before discussing the ID3 algorithm, we’ll go through few definitions. Entropy Entropy, \\nalso called as Shannon Entropy is denoted by H(S) for a finite set S, is the measure of the amount of \\nuncertainty or randomness in data. \\n \\nIntuitively, it tells us about the predictability of a certain event. Example, consider a coin toss whose \\nprobability of heads is 0.5 and probability of tails is 0.5. Here the entropy is the highest possible, since \\nthere’s no way of determining what the outcome might be. Alternatively, consider a coin which has \\nheads on both the sides, the entropy of such an event can be predicted perfectly since we know \\nbeforehand that it’ll always be heads. In other words, this event has no randomness hence it’s entropy \\nis zero. In particular, lower values imply less uncertainty while higher values imply high \\nuncertainty. Information Gain Information gain is also called as Kullback-Leibler divergence denoted by \\nIG(S,A) for a set S is the effective change in entropy after deciding on a particular attribute A. It \\nmeasures the relative change in entropy with respect to the independent variables \\n \\n\\uf028\\n\\uf029\\n\\uf028\\uf029\\n\\uf028\\n\\uf029\\nA\\nS\\nH\\nS\\nH\\nA\\nS\\nIG\\n,\\n,\\n\\uf02d\\n\\uf03d\\n \\nAlternatively, \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere IG(S, A) is the information gain by applying feature A. H(S) is the Entropy of the entire set, while \\nthe second term calculates the Entropy after applying the feature A, where P(x) is the probability of \\nevent x. Let’s understand this with the help of an example Consider a piece of data collected over the \\ncourse of 14 days where the features are Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind and the outcome \\nvariable is whether Golf was played on the day. Now, our job is to build a predictive model which takes \\nin above 4 parameters and predicts whether Golf will be played on the day.

The \\nalgorithm is then used to identify the “class” within which a target variable would most likely fall. \\nAn example of a classification-type problem would be determining who will or will not subscribe to a \\ndigital platform; or who will or will not graduate from high school. \\nThese are examples of simple binary classifications where the categorical dependent variable can \\nassume only one of two, mutually exclusive values. In other cases, you might have to predict among a \\nnumber of different variables. For instance, you may have to predict which type of smartphone a \\nconsumer may decide to purchase. \\nIn such cases, there are multiple values for the categorical dependent variable. Here’s what a classic \\nclassification tree looks like'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 33}, page_content='29 \\n \\n \\n2.1.2.2. Regression Trees \\nA regression tree refers to an algorithm where the target variable is and the algorithm is used to \\npredict it’s value. As an example of a regression type problem, you may want to predict the selling \\nprices of a residential house, which is a continuous dependent variable. \\nThis will depend on both continuous factors like square footage as well as categorical factors like the \\nstyle of home, area in which the property is located and so on. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen to use Classification and Regression Trees \\nClassification trees are used when the dataset needs to be split into classes which belong to the \\nresponse variable. In many cases, the classes Yes or No. \\nIn other words, they are just two and mutually exclusive. In some cases, there may be more than two \\nclasses in which case a variant of the classification tree algorithm is used. \\nRegression trees, on the other hand, are used when the response variable is continuous. For instance, if \\nthe response variable is something like the price of a property or the temperature of the day, a \\nregression tree is used. \\nIn other words, regression trees are used for prediction-type problems while classification trees are \\nused for classification-type problems. \\n \\nHow Classification and Regression Trees Work \\nA classification tree splits the dataset based on the homogeneity of data. Say, for instance, \\nthere are two variables; income and age; which determine whether or not a consumer will buy a \\nparticular kind of phone. \\nIf the training data shows that 95% of people who are older than 30 bought the phone, the data gets \\nsplit there and age becomes a top node in the tree. This split makes the data “95% pure”. Measures of \\nimpurity like entropy or Gini index are used to quantify the homogeneity of the data when it comes to \\nclassification trees.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 34}, page_content='30 \\n \\nIn a regression tree, a regression model is fit to the target variable using each of the independent \\nvariables. After this, the data is split at several points for each independent variable. \\nAt each such point, the error between the predicted values and actual values is squared to get “A Sum \\nof Squared Errors” (SSE). The SSE is compared across the variables and the variable or point which has \\nthe lowest SSE is chosen as the split point. This process is continued recursively. \\n \\n \\nAdvantages of Classification and Regression Trees \\nThe purpose of the analysis conducted by any classification or regression tree is to create a set of if-else \\nconditions that allow for the accurate prediction or classification of a case. \\n(i) The Results are Simplistic \\nThe interpretation of results summarized in classification or regression trees is usually fairly simple. The \\nsimplicity of results helps in the following ways. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt allows for the rapid classification of new observations. That’s because it is much simpler to \\nevaluate just one or two logical conditions than to compute scores using complex nonlinear \\nequations for each group. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt can often result in a simpler model which explains why the observations are either classified \\nor predicted in a certain way. For instance, business problems are much easier to explain with \\nif-then statements than with complex nonlinear equations. \\n(ii) Classification and Regression Trees are Nonparametric & Nonlinear \\nThe results from classification and regression trees can be summarized in simplistic if-then conditions. \\nThis negates the need for the following implicit assumptions. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe predictor variables and the dependent variable are linear. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe predictor variables and the dependent variable follow some specific nonlinear link function. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe predictor variables and the dependent variable are monotonic. \\nSince there is no need for such implicit assumptions, classification and regression tree methods are well \\nsuited to data mining. This is because there is very little knowledge or assumptions that can be made \\nbeforehand about how the different variables are related. \\nAs a result, classification and regression trees can actually reveal relationships between these variables \\nthat would not have been possible using other techniques. \\n(iii) Classification and Regression Trees Implicitly Perform Feature Selection \\nFeature selection or variable screening is an important part of analytics. When we use decision trees, \\nthe top few nodes on which the tree is split are the most important variables within the set. As a result, \\nfeature selection gets performed automatically and we don’t need to do it again. \\nLimitations of Classification and Regression Trees'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 35}, page_content='31 \\n \\nClassification and regression tree tutorials, as well as classification and regression tree ppts, exist in \\nabundance. This is a testament to the popularity of these decision trees and how frequently they are \\nused. However, these decision trees are not without their disadvantages. \\nThere are many classification and regression trees examples where the use of a decision tree has not \\nled to the optimal result. Here are some of the limitations of classification and regression trees. \\n(i) Overfitting \\nOverfitting occurs when the tree takes into account a lot of noise that exists in the data and \\ncomes up with an inaccurate result. \\n(ii) High variance \\nIn this case, a small variance in the data can lead to a very high variance in the prediction, \\nthereby affecting the stability of the outcome. \\n(iii) Low bias \\nA decision tree that is very complex usually has a low bias. This makes it very difficult for the \\nmodel to incorporate any new data. \\n \\nWhat is a CART in Machine Learning? \\nA Classification and Regression Tree (CART) is a predictive algorithm used in machine learning. It \\nexplains how a target variable’s values can be predicted based on other values. \\nIt is a decision tree where each fork is a split in a predictor variable and each node at the end has a \\nprediction for the target variable. \\nThe CART algorithm is an important decision tree algorithm that lies at the foundation of machine \\nlearning. Moreover, it is also the basis for other powerful machine learning algorithms like bagged \\ndecision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees. \\nSumming up \\nThe Classification and regression tree (CART) methodology is one of the oldest and most fundamental \\nalgorithms. It is used to predict outcomes based on certain predictor variables. \\nThey are excellent for data mining tasks because they require very little data pre-processing. Decision \\ntree models are easy to understand and implement which gives them a strong advantage when \\ncompared to other analytical models. \\n \\n2.2. Regression \\nRegression Analysis in Machine learning \\nRegression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent \\n(target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables. More \\nspecifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is \\nchanging corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It \\npredicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc. \\n \\nWe can understand the concept of regression analysis using the below example: \\n \\nExample: Suppose there is a marketing company A, who does various advertisement every year and get \\nsales on that. The below list shows the advertisement made by the company in the last 5 years and the \\ncorresponding sales:'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 36}, page_content='32 \\n \\n \\n \\nNow, the company wants to do the advertisement of $200 in the year 2019 and wants to know the \\nprediction about the sales for this year. So to solve such type of prediction problems in machine \\nlearning, we need regression analysis. \\nRegression is a supervised learning technique which helps in finding the correlation between variables \\nand enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on the one or more predictor variables. \\nIt is mainly used for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect \\nrelationship between variables. \\nIn Regression, we plot a graph between the variables which best fits the given datapoints, using this \\nplot, the machine learning model can make predictions about the data. In simple words, \"Regression \\nshows a line or curve that passes through all the datapoints on target-predictor graph in such a way \\nthat the vertical distance between the datapoints and the regression line is minimum.\" The distance \\nbetween datapoints and line tells whether a model has captured a strong relationship or not. \\n \\nSome examples of regression can be as: \\no \\nPrediction of rain using temperature and other factors \\no \\nDetermining Market trends \\no \\nPrediction of road accidents due to rash driving. \\n \\nTerminologies Related to the Regression Analysis: \\no \\nDependent Variable: The main factor in Regression analysis which we want to predict or \\nunderstand is called the dependent variable. It is also called target variable. \\no \\nIndependent Variable: The factors which affect the dependent variables or which are used to \\npredict the values of the dependent variables are called independent variable, also called as \\na predictor. \\no \\nOutliers: Outlier is an observation which contains either very low value or very high value in \\ncomparison to other observed values. An outlier may hamper the result, so it should be \\navoided. \\no \\nMulticollinearity: If the independent variables are highly correlated with each other than other \\nvariables, then such condition is called Multicollinearity. It should not be present in the dataset, \\nbecause it creates problem while ranking the most affecting variable. \\no \\nUnderfitting and Overfitting: If our algorithm works well with the training dataset but not well \\nwith test dataset, then such problem is called Overfitting. And if our algorithm does not \\nperform well even with training dataset, then such problem is called underfitting.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 37}, page_content='33 \\n \\nWhy do we use Regression Analysis? \\nAs mentioned above, Regression analysis helps in the prediction of a continuous variable. There are \\nvarious scenarios in the real world where we need some future predictions such as weather condition, \\nsales prediction, marketing trends, etc., for such case we need some technology which can make \\npredictions more accurately. So for such case we need Regression analysis which is a statistical method \\nand used in machine learning and data science. Below are some other reasons for using Regression \\nanalysis: \\no \\nRegression estimates the relationship between the target and the independent variable. \\no \\nIt is used to find the trends in data. \\no \\nIt helps to predict real/continuous values. \\no \\nBy performing the regression, we can confidently determine the most important factor, the \\nleast important factor, and how each factor is affecting the other factors. \\n \\nTypes of Regression \\nThere are various types of regressions which are used in data science and machine learning. Each type \\nhas its own importance on different scenarios, but at the core, all the regression methods analyze the \\neffect of the independent variable on dependent variables.

Bias has the same input, and weight equals to 1. Here the total of weighted inputs \\ncan be in the range of 0 to positive infinity. Here, to keep the response in the limits of the desired value, a certain \\nmaximum value is benchmarked, and the total of weighted inputs is passed through the activation function. \\nThe activation function refers to the set of transfer functions used to achieve the desired output. There is a \\ndifferent kind of the activation function, but primarily either linear or non-linear sets of functions. Some of the \\ncommonly used sets of activation functions are the Binary, linear, and Tan hyperbolic sigmoidal activation \\nfunctions. Let us take a look at each of them in details: \\n \\nBinary: \\nIn binary activation function, the output is either a one or a 0. Here, to accomplish this, there is a threshold \\nvalue set up. If the net weighted input of neurons is more than 1, then the final output of the activation function is \\nreturned as one or else the output is returned as 0. \\n \\nSigmoidal Hyperbolic: \\nThe Sigmoidal Hyperbola function is generally seen as an \"S\" shaped curve. Here the tan hyperbolic \\nfunction is used to approximate output from the actual net input.

PERCEPTRONS \\nOne type of ANN system is based on a unit called a perceptron, illustrated in below Figure: A \\nperceptron takes a vector of real-valued inputs, calculates a linear combination of these inputs, then \\noutputs a 1 if the result is greater than some threshold and -1 otherwise. More precisely, given inputs xl \\nthrough xn the output o(xl, . . . , xn) computed by the perceptron is \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere eachwi  is a real-valued constant, or weight, that determines the contribution of input xi  to \\nthe perceptron output.

Of course, some sets of positive and negative examples cannot be \\nseparated by any hyperplane. Those that can be separated are called linearly separable sets of \\nexamples.  \\n \\n \\nThe decision surface represented by a two-input perceptron. (a) A set of training examples and \\nthe decision surface of a perceptron that classifies them correctly. (b) A set of training examples that is \\nnot linearly separable (i.e., that cannot be correctly classified by any straight line). xl and x2 are the \\nPerceptron inputs. Positive examples are indicated by \"+\", negative by \"-\". The inputs are fed to multiple \\nunits, and the outputs of these units are then input to a second, final stage. One way is to represent the \\nBoolean function in disjunctive normal form (i.e., as the disjunction (OR) of a set of conjunctions (ANDs) \\nof the inputs and their negations). Note that the input to an AND perceptron can be negated simply by \\nchanging the sign of the corresponding input weight. Because networks of threshold units can represent \\na rich variety of functions and because single units alone cannot, we will generally be interested in \\nlearning multilayer networks of threshold units. \\n \\nThe Perceptron Training Rule \\nAlthough we are interested in learning networks of many interconnected units, let us begin by \\nunderstanding how to learn the weights for a single perceptron. Here the precise learning problem is to \\ndetermine a weight vector that causes the perceptron to produce the correct 1\\n\\uf0b1 output for each of the \\ngiven training examples. \\nSeveral algorithms are known to solve this learning problem. Here we consider two: the \\nperceptron rule and the delta rule. These two algorithms are guaranteed to converge to somewhat \\ndifferent acceptable hypotheses, under somewhat different conditions. They are important to ANNs \\nbecause they provide the basis for learning networks of many units. \\nOne way to learn an acceptable weight vector is to begin with random weights, then iteratively \\napply the perceptron to each training example, modifying the perceptron weights whenever it \\nmisclassifies an example. This process is repeated, iterating through the training examples as many \\ntimes as needed until \\nthe perceptron classifies all training examples correctly. Weights are modified at each step according to \\nthe perceptron training rule, which revises the weight wi associated with input xi according to the rule \\n \\n \\nHere t is the target output for the current training example, o is the output generated by the'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 51}, page_content='47 \\n \\nperceptron, and \\uf068is a positive constant called the learning rate. The role of the learning rate is to \\nmoderate the degree to which weights are changed at each step. It is usually set to some small value \\n(e.g., 0.1) and is sometimes made to decay as the number of weight-tuning iterations increases. \\nWhy should this update rule converge toward successful weight values? To get an intuitive feel, \\nconsider some specific cases. Suppose the training example is correctly classified already by the \\nperceptron. In this case, (t - o) is zero, making wi\\n\\uf044\\n zero, so that no weights are updated. Suppose the \\nperceptron outputs a -1, when the target output is +1. To make the perceptron output a+1 instead of -1 \\nin this case, the weights must be altered to increase the value of \\n\\uf0ae\\n\\uf0ae\\nx\\nw.\\n For example, if xi>0, then \\nincreasing wi will bring the perceptron closer to correctly classifying this example. Notice the training \\nrule will increase w, in this case, because (t - o),\\uf068, and xi are all positive. For example, if xi = .8, \\uf068 = 0.1, \\nt = 1, and o = - 1, then the weight update will be wi\\n\\uf044\\n = \\uf068 (t - o)xi = O.1(1 - (-1))0.8 = 0.16. On the \\nother hand, if t = -1 and o = 1, then weights associated with positive xi will be decreased rather than \\nincreased. \\n \\nIn fact, the above learning procedure can be proven to converge within a finite number of applications \\nof the perceptron training rule to a weight vector that correctly classifies all training examples, provided \\nthe training examples are linearly separable and provided a sufficiently small \\uf068 is used. If the data are \\nnot linearly separable, convergence is not assured. \\n \\nGradient Descent and the Delta Rule \\nAlthough the perceptron rule finds a successful weight vector when the training examples are \\nlinearly separable, it can fail to converge if the examples are not linearly separable. A second training \\nrule, called the delta rule, is designed to overcome this difficulty. If the training examples are not \\nlinearly separable, the delta rule converges toward a best-fit approximation to the target concept. The \\nkey idea behind the delta rule is to use gradient descent to search the hypothesis space of possible \\nweight vectors to find the weights that best fit the training examples. This rule is important because \\ngradient descent provides the basis for the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm, which can learn networks \\nwith many interconnected units. It is also important because gradient descent can serve as the basis for \\nlearning algorithms that must search through hypothesis spaces containing many different types of \\ncontinuously parameterized hypotheses.  \\nThe delta training rule is best understood by considering the task of training an unthresholded \\nperceptron; that is, a linear unit for which the output o is given by \\n \\n \\n \\nThus, a linear unit corresponds to the first stage of a perceptron, without the threshold. \\nIn order to derive a weight learning rule for linear units, let us begin by specifying a measure for the \\ntraining error of a hypothesis (weight vector), relative to the training examples. Although there are \\nmany ways to define this error, one common measure that will turn out to be especially convenient is \\n \\nwhere D is the set of training examples, td is the target output for training example d, and od is the \\noutput of the linear unit for training example d.

Of course E also depends on the particular set of training examples, but we assume these \\nare fixed during training, so we do not bother to write E as an explicit function of these.

It is different from logistic \\nregression, in that between the input and the output layer, there can be one or more non-linear layers, \\ncalled hidden layers. Figure  shows a one hidden layer MLP with scalar output. \\n \\nThe leftmost layer, known as the input layer, consists of a set of neurons {xi|x1,x2,...,xm} representing the \\ninput features.

Support Vector Machines  \\n \\nSupport Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, \\nwhich is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for \\nClassification problems in Machine Learning. The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or \\ndecision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the \\nnew data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane. \\nSVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are \\ncalled as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine. Consider the \\nbelow diagram in which there are two different categories that are classified using a decision boundary \\nor hyperplane:  \\n \\n \\nExample: SVM can be understood with the example that we have used in the KNN classifier. Suppose \\nwe see a strange cat that also has some features of dogs, so if we want a model that can accurately \\nidentify whether it is a cat or dog, so such a model can be created by using the SVM algorithm. We will \\nfirst train our model with lots of images of cats and dogs so that it can learn about different features of \\ncats and dogs, and then we test it with this strange creature. So as support vector creates a decision \\nboundary between these two data (cat and dog) and choose extreme cases (support vectors), it will see \\nthe extreme case of cat and dog. On the basis of the support vectors, it will classify it as a cat.

This best boundary is known as the hyperplane of SVM. \\nThe dimensions of the hyperplane depend on the features present in the dataset, which means if there \\nare 2 features (as shown in image), then hyperplane will be a straight line. And if there are 3 features, \\nthen hyperplane will be a 2-dimension plane. \\nWe always create a hyperplane that has a maximum margin, which means the maximum distance \\nbetween the data points. \\n \\nSupport Vectors: \\nThe data points or vectors that are the closest to the hyperplane and which affect the position of the \\nhyperplane are termed as Support Vector. Since these vectors support the hyperplane, hence called a \\nSupport vector. How does SVM works? \\n \\n2.4.1. Linear SVM: \\nThe working of the SVM algorithm can be understood by using an example. Suppose we have a dataset \\nthat has two tags (green and blue), and the dataset has two features x1 and x2. We want a classifier \\nthat can classify the pair(x1, x2) of coordinates in either green or blue. Consider the below image: \\n \\nSo as it is 2-d space so by just using a straight line, we can easily separate these two classes. But there \\ncan be multiple lines that can separate these classes.

SVM algorithm finds the closest point of the lines from both the classes. These \\npoints are called support vectors. The distance between the vectors and the hyperplane is called \\nas margin. And the goal of SVM is to maximize this margin. The hyperplane with maximum margin is \\ncalled the optimal hyperplane.  \\n \\n2.4.2. Non-Linear SVM: \\n           If data is linearly arranged, then we can separate it by using a straight line, but for non-linear \\ndata, we cannot draw a single straight line. Consider the below image: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSo to separate these data points, we need to add one more dimension. For linear data, we have used two dimensions \\nx and y, so for non-linear data, we will add a third dimension z. It can be calculated as: \\nz=x2 +y2 \\nBy adding the third dimension, the sample space will become as below image:'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 56}, page_content='52 \\n \\n \\nSo now, SVM will divide the datasets into classes in the following way. Consider the below image: \\n \\n \\nSince we are in 3-d Space, hence it is looking like a plane parallel to the x-axis. If we convert it in 2d \\nspace with z=1, then it will become as: \\n \\n \\nHence we get a circumference of radius 1 in case of non-linear data. \\n \\n2.4.3.

SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick in which kernel takes a low dimensional \\ninput space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space. In simple words, kernel converts non-\\nseparable problems into separable problems by adding more dimensions to it. It makes SVM more \\npowerful, flexible and accurate. The following are some of the types of kernels used by SVM. \\nLinear Kernel \\nIt can be used as a dot product between any two observations. The formula of linear kernel is as below  \\n \\nK(x,xi)=sum(x∗xi) \\n \\nFrom the above formula, we can see that the product between two vectors say 𝑥 & 𝑥𝑖 is the sum of the \\nmultiplication of each pair of input values. \\n \\n2.5.

Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights \\nfrom the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while learning \\nnew things. It can be defined as: \\n \\n“Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using \\nunlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.” \\n \\nUnsupervised learning cannot be directly applied to a regression or classification problem \\nbecause unlike supervised learning, we have the input data but no corresponding output data. The goal \\nof unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of dataset, group that data according to \\nsimilarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format \\n \\nExample: Suppose the unsupervised learning algorithm is given an input dataset containing images of \\ndifferent types of cats and dogs.

Though these are \\ngenerally successful, no one single algorithm is always the most accurate. Now, we are going to discuss \\nmodels composed of multiple learners that complement each other so that by combining them, we \\nattain higher accuracy. \\n \\nThere are also different ways the multiple base-learners are combined to generate the final \\noutput: \\n \\nFigure2: General Idea - Combining Multiple Learners'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 65}, page_content='61 \\n \\n \\n \\nMultiexpert combination  \\nMultiexpert combination methods have base-learners that work in parallel. These methods can \\nin turn be divided into two: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIn the global approach, also called learner fusion, given an input, all base-learners generate an \\noutput and all these outputs are used.  \\nExamples are voting and stacking. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIn the local approach, or learner selection, for example, in mixture of experts, there is a gating \\nmodel, which looks at the input and chooses one (or very few) of the learners as responsible for \\ngenerating the output. \\n \\nMultistage combination \\nMultistage combination methods use a serial approach where the next base-learner is trained \\nwith or tested on only the instances where the previous base-learners are not accurate enough. The \\nidea is that the base-learners (or the different representations they use) are sorted in increasing \\ncomplexity so that a complex base-learner is not used (or its complex representation is not extracted) \\nunless the preceding simpler base-learners are not confident.  \\nAn example is cascading. \\n \\nLet us say that we have L base-learners. We denote by dj(x) the prediction of base-learner Mj given the \\narbitrary dimensional input x. In the case of multiple representations, each Mj uses a different input \\nrepresentation xj . The final prediction is calculated from the predictions of \\nthe base-learners: \\n \\ny = f (d1, d2, . . . , dL |Φ) \\n \\nwhere f (·) is the combining function with Φ denoting its parameters.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 66}, page_content='62 \\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Base-learners are dj and their outputs are combined using f (·). This is for a single \\noutput; in the case of classification, each base-learner has K outputs that are separately used to \\ncalculate yi, and then we choose the maximum.  Note that here all learners observe the same input; it \\nmay be the case that different learners observe different representations of the same input object or \\nevent.  \\n \\nWhen there are K outputs, for each learner there are dji(x), i = 1, . . . , K, \\nj = 1, . . . , L, and, combining them, we also generate K values, yi, i = 1, . . . , K and then for example in \\nclassification, we choose the class with \\nthe maximum yi value: \\n                                   \\n \\n \\n3.2 Voting \\nThe simplest way to combine multiple classifiers is by voting, which corresponds to taking a \\nlinear combination of the learn \\n \\ners, Refer figure 1. \\n \\n \\nThis is also known as ensembles and linear opinion pools. In the sim plest case, all learners are \\ngiven equal weight and we have simple voting that corresponds to taking an average. Still, taking a \\n(weighted) sum is only one of the possibilities and there are also other combination rules, as shown in \\ntable 1. If the outputs are not posterior probabilities, these rules require that outputs be normalized to \\nthe same scale \\n \\nTable 1 - Classifier combination rules'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 67}, page_content='63 \\n \\nAn example of the use of these rules is shown in table 2, which demonstrates the effects of \\ndifferent rules. Sum rule is the most intuitive and is the most widely used in practice. Median rule is \\nmore robust to outliers; minimum and maximum rules are pessimistic and optimistic, respectively. With \\nthe product rule, each learner has veto power; regardless of the other ones, if one learner has an \\noutput of 0, the overall output goes to 0. Note that after the combination rules, yi do not necessarily \\nsum up to 1. \\n \\nTable 2: Example of combination rules on three learners and three classes \\n \\nIn weighted sum, dji is the vote of learner j for class Ci and wj is the weight of its vote. Simple voting is a \\nspecial case where all voters have equal weight, namely, wj = 1/L. In classification, this is called plurality \\nvoting where the class having the maximum number of votes is the winner. \\n \\nWhen there are two classes, this is majority voting where the winning class gets more than half of the \\nvotes. If the voters can also supply the additional information of how much they vote for each class \\n(e.g., by the posterior probability), then after normalization, these can be used as weights in a weighted \\nvoting scheme. Equivalently, if dji are the class posterior probabilities, P(Ci | x,Mj ), then we can just sum \\nthem up (wj = 1/L) and choose the class with maximum yi . \\n \\nIn the case of regression, simple or weighted averaging or median can be used to fuse the outputs of \\nbase-regressors. Median is more robust to noise than the average. \\n \\nAnother possible way to find wj is to assess the accuracies of the learners (regressor or classifier) on a \\nseparate validation set and use that information to compute the weights, so that we give more weights \\nto more accurate learners. \\n \\nVoting schemes can be seen as approximations under a Bayesian framework with weights \\napproximating prior model probabilities, and model decisions approximating model-conditional \\nlikelihoods.  \\n \\n \\n \\nSimple voting corresponds to a uniform prior. If we have a prior distribution preferring simpler models, \\nthis would give larger weights to them. We cannot integrate over all models; we only choose a subset \\nfor which we believe P(Mj ) is high, or we can have another Bayesian step and calculate P(Ci | x,Mj ), the \\nprobability of a model given the sample, and sample high probable models from this density. \\n \\nLet us assume that dj are iid with expected value E[dj] and variance Var(dj ), then when we take a simple'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 68}, page_content='64 \\n \\naverage with wj = 1/L, the expected value and variance of the output are \\n \\n \\nWe see that the expected value does not change, so the bias does not change. But variance, and \\ntherefore mean square error, decreases as the number of independent voters, L, increases. In the \\ngeneral case, \\n \\n \\n \\nwhich implies that if learners are positively correlated, variance (and error) increase. We can thus view \\nusing different algorithms and input features as efforts to decrease, if not completely eliminate, the \\npositive correlation. \\n \\n3.3 Error-Correcting Output Codes \\nThe Error-Correcting Output Codes method is a technique that allows a multi-class classification \\nproblem to be reframed as multiple binary classification problems, allowing the use of native binary \\nclassification models to be used directly. \\n \\nUnlike one-vs-rest and one-vs-one methods that offer a similar solution by dividing a multi-class \\nclassification problem into a fixed number of binary classification problems, the error-correcting output \\ncodes technique allows each class to be encoded as an arbitrary number of binary classification \\nproblems. When an overdetermined representation is used, it allows the extra models to act as “error-\\ncorrection” predictions that can result in better predictive performance. \\n \\nIn error-correcting output codes (ECOC), the main classification task is defined in terms of a \\nnumber of subtasks that are implemented by the base-learners. The idea is that the original task of \\nseparating one class from all other classes may be a difficult problem. Instead, we want to define a set \\nof simpler classification problems, each specializing in one aspect of the task, and combining these \\nsimpler classifiers, we get the final classifier. \\n \\nBase-learners are binary classifiers having output −1/ + 1, and there is a code matrix W of K × L whose K \\nrows are the binary codes of classes in terms of the L base-learners dj. For example, if the second row of \\nW is [−1,+1,+1,−1], this means that for us to say an instance belongs to C2, the instance should be on the \\nnegative side of d1 and d4, and on the positive side of d2 and d3. Similarly, the columns of the code \\nmatrix defines the task of the base-learners. For example, if the third column is [−1,+1,+1]T , we \\nunderstand that the task of the third base-learner, d3, is to separate the instances of C1 from the \\ninstances of C2 and C3 combined. This is how we form the training set of the base-learners. For example \\nin this case, all instances labeled with C2 and C3 form X+\\n3 and instances labeled with C1 form X−\\n3, and d3 is \\ntrained so that xt ∈ X+\\n3 give output +1 and xt ∈ X−\\n3 give output −1. \\n \\nThe code matrix thus allows us to define a polychotomy (K > 2 classification problem) in terms of \\ndichotomies (K = 2 classification problem), and it is a method that is applicable using any learning'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 69}, page_content='65 \\n \\nalgorithm to implement the dichotomizer base-learners—for example, linear or multilayer perceptrons \\n(with a single output), decision trees, or SVMs whose original definition is for two-class problems. \\nThe typical one discriminant per class setting corresponds to the diagonal code matrix where L = K. For \\nexample, for K = 4, \\n \\n \\nwe have \\n                    \\n \\nThe problem here is that if there is an error with one of the baselearners, there may be a \\nmisclassification because the class code words are so similar. So the approach in error-correcting codes \\nis to have L > K and increase the Hamming distance between the code words. One possibility is pairwise \\nseparation of classes where there is a separate baselearner to separate Ci from Cj, for i < j. In this case, L \\n= K(K − 1)/2 and with K = 4, the code matrix is \\n \\n \\nwhere a 0 entry denotes “don’t care.” That is, d1 is trained to separate C1 from C2 and does not use the \\ntraining instances belonging to the other classes. Similarly, we say that an instance belongs to C2 if d1 = \\n−1 and d4 = d5 = +1, and we do not consider the values of d2, d3, and d6. The problem here is that L is \\nO(K2), and for large K pairwise separation may not be feasible. \\n \\nIf we can have L high, we can just randomly generate the code matrix with −1/ + 1 and this will work \\nfine, but if we want to keep L low, we need to optimize W. The approach is to set L beforehand and \\nthen find W such that the distances between rows, and at the same time the distances between \\ncolumns, are as large as possible, in terms of Hamming distance. With K classes, there are 2(K-1) − 1 \\npossible columns, namely, two-class problems. This is because K bits can be written in 2K different ways \\nand complements (e.g., “0101” and “1010,” from our point of view, define the same discriminant) \\ndividing the possible combinations by 2 and then subtracting 1 because a column of all 0s (or 1s) is \\nuseless. For example, when K = 4, we have \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen K is large, for a given value of L, we look for L columns out of the 2(K-1)−1. We would like these \\ncolumns of W to be as different as possible so that the tasks to be learned by the base-learners are as \\ndifferent from each other as possible. At the same time, we would like the rows of W to be as different \\nas possible so that we can have maximum error correction in case one or more base-learners fail. \\n \\nECOC can be written as a voting scheme where the entries of W, wij , are considered as vote weights:'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 70}, page_content='66 \\n \\n \\nand then we choose the class with the highest yi . Taking a weighted sum and then choosing the \\nmaximum instead of checking for an exact match allows dj to no longer need to be binary but to take a \\nvalue between −1 and +1, carrying soft certainties instead of hard decisions. Note that a value pj \\nbetween 0 and 1, for example, a posterior probability, can be converted to a value dj between −1 and +1 \\nsimply as \\n \\nOne problem with ECOC is that because the code matrix W is set a priori, there is no guarantee that the \\nsubtasks as defined by the columns of W will be simple. \\n \\n3.4 Bagging \\nBootstrap aggregating, often abbreviated as bagging, involves having each model in the \\nensemble vote with equal weight. In order to promote model variance, bagging trains each model in the \\nensemble using a randomly drawn subset of the training set. As an example, the random \\nforest algorithm combines random decision trees with bagging to achieve very high classification \\naccuracy. \\nThe simplest method of combining classifiers is known as bagging, which stands for bootstrap \\naggregating, the statistical description of the method. This is fine if you know what a bootstrap is, but \\nfairly useless if you don’t. A bootstrap sample is a sample taken from the original dataset with \\nreplacement, so that we may get some data several times and others not at all. The bootstrap sample is \\nthe same size as the original, and lots and lots of these samples are taken: B of them, where B is at least \\n50, and could even be in the thousands. The name bootstrap is more popular in computer science than \\nanywhere else, since there is also a bootstrap loader, which is the first program to run when a computer \\nis turned on. It comes from the nonsensical idea of ‘picking yourself up by your bootstraps,’ which \\nmeans lifting yourself up by your shoelaces, and is meant to imply starting from nothing. \\nBootstrap sampling seems like a very strange thing to do. We’ve taken a perfectly good dataset, \\nmucked it up by sampling from it, which might be good if we had made a smaller dataset (since it would \\nbe faster), but we still ended up with a dataset the same size. Worse, we’ve done it lots of times. Surely \\nthis is just a way to burn up computer time without gaining anything. The benefit of it is that we will get \\nlots of learners that perform slightly differently, which is exactly what we want for an ensemble \\nmethod. Another benefit is that estimates of the accuracy of the classification function can be made \\nwithout complicated analytic work, by throwing computer resources at the problem (technically, \\nbagging is a variance reducing algorithm; the meaning of this will become clearer when we talk about \\nbias and variance). Having taken a set of bootstrap samples, the bagging method simply requires that \\nwe fit a model to each dataset, and then combine them by taking the output to be the majority vote of \\nall the classifiers. A NumPy implementation is shown next, and then we will look at a simple example. \\n \\n# Compute bootstrap samples \\nsamplePoints = np.random.randint(0,nPoints,(nPoints,nSamples)) \\nclassifiers = [] \\n \\nfor i in range(nSamples): \\nsample = [] \\nsampleTarget = [] \\nfor j in range(nPoints): \\nsample.append(data[samplePoints[j,i]])'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 71}, page_content='67 \\n \\nsampleTarget.append(targets[samplePoints[j,i]]) \\n# Train classifiers \\nclassifiers.append(self.tree.make_tree(sample,sampleTarget,features)) \\n \\nThe example consists of taking the party data that was used to demonstrate the decision tree, and \\nrestricting the trees to stumps, so that they can make a classification based on just one variable \\n \\nWhen we want to construct the decision tree to decide what to do in the evening, we start by listing \\neverything that we’ve done for the past few days to get a suitable dataset (here, the last ten days): \\n \\n \\nThe output of a decision tree that uses the whole dataset for this is not surprising: it takes the two \\nlargest classes, and separates them. However, using just stumps of trees and 20 samples, bagging can \\nseparate the data perfectly, as this output shows: \\n \\n \\n \\n3.4.1 RANDOM FORESTS \\nA random forest is an ensemble learning method where multiple decision trees are constructed \\nand then they are merged to get a more accurate prediction. \\nIf there is one method in machine learning that has grown in popularity over the last few years, \\nthen it is the idea of random forests. The concept has been around for longer than that, with several \\ndifferent people inventing variations, but the name that is most strongly attached to it is that of \\nBreiman, who also described the CART algorithm in unit 2. \\n \\nFigure 3: Example of random forest with majority voting'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 72}, page_content='68 \\n \\n \\n \\nThe idea is largely that if one tree is good, then many trees (a forest) should be better, provided \\nthat there is enough variety between them. The most interesting thing about a random forest is the \\nways that it creates randomness from a standard dataset. The first of the methods that it uses is the \\none that we have just seen: bagging. If we wish to create a forest then we can make the trees different \\nby training them on slightly different data, so we take bootstrap samples from the dataset for each tree. \\nHowever, this isn’t enough randomness yet. The other obvious place where it is possible to add \\nrandomness is to limit the choices that the decision tree can make. At each node, a random subset of \\nthe features is given to the tree, and it can only pick from that subset rather than from the whole set. \\nAs well as increasing the randomness in the training of each tree, it also speeds up the training, \\nsince there are fewer features to search over at each stage. Of course, it does introduce a new \\nparameter (how many features to consider), but the random forest does not seem to be very sensitive \\nto this parameter; in practice, a subset size that is the square root of the number of features seems to \\nbe common. The effect of these two forms of randomness is to reduce the variance without effecting \\nthe bias. Another benefit of this is that there is no need to prune the trees. There is another parameter \\nthat we don’t know how to choose yet, which is the number of trees to put into the forest. However, \\nthis is fairly easy to pick if we want optimal results: we can keep on building trees until the error stops \\ndecreasing.  \\nOnce the set of trees are trained, the output of the forest is the majority vote for classification, \\nas with the other committee methods that we have seen, or the mean response for regression. And \\nthose are pretty much the main features needed for creating a random forest. The algorithm is given \\nnext before we see some results of using the random forest. \\n \\nAlgorithm \\nHere is an outline of the random forest algorithm. \\n1. The random forests algorithm generates many classification trees. Each tree is generated as \\nfollows: \\na) If the number of examples in the training set is N, take a sample of N examples at \\nrandom - but with replacement, from the original data. This sample will be the training \\nset for generating the tree. \\nb) If there are M input variables, a number m is specified such that at each node, m \\nvariables are selected at random out of the M and the best split on these m is used to'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 73}, page_content='69 \\n \\nsplit the node. The value of m is held constant during the generation of the various \\ntrees in the forest. \\nc) Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. \\n2. To classify a new object from an input vector, put the input vector down each of the trees in the \\nforest. Each tree gives a classification, and we say the tree “votes” for that class. The forest \\nchooses the classification \\n \\nThe implementation of this is very easy: we modify the decision to take an extra parameter, which is m, \\nthe number of features that should be used in the selection set at each stage. We will look at an \\nexample of using it shortly as a comparison to boosting. \\n \\nLooking at the algorithm you might be able to see that it is a very unusual machine learning \\nmethod because it is embarrassingly parallel: since the trees do not depend upon each other, you can \\nboth create and get decisions from different trees on different individual processors if you have them. \\nThis means that the random forest can run on as many processors as you have available with nearly \\nlinear speedup. \\n \\nThere is one more nice thing to mention about random forests, which is that with a little bit of \\nprogramming effort they come with built-in test data: the bootstrap sample will miss out about 35% of \\nthe data on average, the so-called out-of-bootstrap examples. If we keep track of these datapoints then \\nthey can be used as novel samples for that particular tree, giving an estimated test error that we get \\nwithout having to use any extra datapoints. \\n \\nThis avoids the need for cross-validation. \\n \\nAs a brief example of using the random forest, we start by demonstrating that the random \\nforest gets the correct results on the Party example that has been used in both this and the previous \\nchapters, based on 10 trees, each trained on 7 samples, and with just two levels allowed in each tree: \\n \\n \\n \\nAs a rather more involved example, the car evaluation dataset in the UCI Repository contains 1,728 \\nexamples aiming to classify whether or not a car is a good purchase based on six attributes. The \\nfollowing results compare a single decision tree, bagging, and a random forest with 50 trees, each based \\non 100 samples, and with a maximum depth of five for each tree.

In boosting, we actively try to generate complementary base-learners by training the \\nnext learner on the mistakes of the previous learners. The original boosting algorithm combines three \\nweak learners to generate a strong learner. A weak learner has error probability less than 1/2, which \\nmakes it better than random guessing on a two-class problem, and a strong learner has arbitrarily small \\nerror probability. \\n \\nOriginal Boosting Concept \\nGiven a large training set, we randomly divide it into three. We use X1 and train d1. We then take X2 \\nand feed it to d1. We take all instances misclassified by d1 and also as many instances on which d1 is \\ncorrect \\nfrom X2, and these together form the training set of d2. We then take X3 and feed it to d1 and d2. The \\ninstances on which d1 and d2 disagree form the training set of d3. During testing, given an instance, we \\ngive it to d1 and d2; if they agree, that is the response, otherwise the response of d3 is taken as the \\noutput. \\n \\n1. Split data X into {X1, X2, X3} \\n2. \\nTrain d1 on X1 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTest d1 on X2 \\n3. Train d2 on d1’s mistakes on X2 (plus some right) \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTest d1 and d2 on X3 \\n4. Train d3 on disagreements between d1 and d2 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nTesting: apply d1 and d2; if disagree, use d3 \\n\\uf0a7 \\nDrawback: need large X \\n \\noverall system has reduced error rate, and the error rate can arbitrarily be reduced by using such \\nsystems recursively, that is, a boosting system of three models used as dj in a higher system. \\n \\nThough it is quite successful, the disadvantage of the original boosting method is that it requires a very \\nlarge training sample. The sample should be divided into three and furthermore, the second and third \\nclassifiers are only trained on a subset on which the previous ones err. So unless one has a quite large \\ntraining set, d2 and d3 will not have training \\nsets of reasonable size. \\n \\n3.5.1AdaBoost \\n         \\nFreund and Schapire (1996) proposed a variant, named AdaBoost, short for adaptive boosting, \\nthat uses the same training set over and over and thus need not be large, but the classifiers should be \\nsimple so that they do not overfit. AdaBoost can also combine an arbitrary number of baselearners, not \\nthree. \\n \\nAdaBoost algorithm'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 76}, page_content='72 \\n \\n \\n \\nThe idea is to modify the probabilities of drawing the instances as a function of the error. Let us say pt\\nj \\ndenotes the probability that the instance pair (xt, rt) is drawn to train the jth base-learner. \\nInitially, all pt\\n1 = 1/N. Then we add new base-learners as follows, starting from j = 1:  Є j denotes the \\nerror rate of dj .  \\nAdaBoost requires that learners are weak, that is,  Є j < 1/2,∀j;  if  not, we stop adding new base-\\nlearners. Note that this error rate is not on the original problem but on the dataset used at step j. We \\ndefine  βj = Є j /(1 −Є j) < 1, and we set pt\\nj+1 = βj pt\\nj if dj correctly classifies xt ; otherwise, pt\\nj +1 = pt\\nj.   \\nBecause pt\\nj+1  should be probabilities, there is a normalization where we divide pt\\nj+1 by  𝑡 pt\\nj+1 , so that \\nthey sum up to 1. This has the effect that the probability of a correctly classified instance is decreased, \\nand the probability of a misclassified instance increases. Then a new sample of the same size is drawn \\nfrom the original sample according to these modified probabilities, pt\\nj+1 with replacement, and is used to \\ntrain dj+1. \\n  \\nThis has the effect that dj+1 focuses more on instances misclassified by dj ; that is why the base-learners \\nare chosen to be simple and not accurate, since otherwise the next training sample would contain only \\na few outlier and noisy instances repeated many times over. For example, with decision trees, decision \\nstumps, which are trees grown only one or two levels, are used. So it is clear that these would have bias \\nbut the decrease in variance is larger and the overall error decreases. An algorithm like the linear \\ndiscriminant has low variance, and we cannot gain by AdaBoosting linear discriminants. \\n. \\n3.5.2 Stacking - Stacked Generalization \\nStacked generalization is a technique proposed by Wolpert (1992) that extends voting in that \\nthe way the output of the base-learners is combined need not be linear but is learned through a \\ncombiner system, f (·|Φ), which is another learner, whose parameters Φ are also trained. (see the \\nbelow given figure)'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 77}, page_content='73 \\n \\n \\nFigure: In stacked generalization, the combiner is another learner and is not restricted to being a linear \\ncombination as in voting. \\n \\ny = f (d1, d2, . . . , dL |Φ) \\n \\nThe combiner learns what the correct output is when the base-learners give a certain output \\ncombination. We cannot train the combiner function on the training data because the base-learners \\nmay be memorizing the training set; the combiner system should actually learn how the baselearners \\nmake errors. Stacking is a means of estimating and correcting for the biases of the base-learners. \\nTherefore, the combiner should be trained on data unused in training the base-learners. \\n \\nIf f (·|w1, . . . , wL) is a linear model with constraints, wi ≥ 0,  𝑗Wj = 1, the optimal weights can be found \\nby constrained regression, but of course we do not need to enforce this; in stacking, there is no \\nrestriction on the combiner function and unlike voting, f (·) can be nonlinear. For example, it may be \\nimplemented as a multilayer perceptron with Φ its connection weights. \\n \\nThe outputs of the base-learners dj define a new L-dimensional space in which the output \\ndiscriminant/regression function is learned by the combiner function. \\n \\nIn stacked generalization, we would like the base-learners to be as different as possible so that they will \\ncomplement each other, and, for this, it is best if they are based on different learning algorithms. If we \\nare combining classifiers that can generate continuous outputs, for example, posterior probabilities, it is \\nbetter that they be the combined rather than hard decisions. \\nWhen we compare a trained combiner as we have in stacking, with a fixed rule such as in \\nvoting, we see that both have their advantages: A trained rule is more flexible and may have less bias, \\nbut adds extra parameters, risks introducing variance, and needs extra time and data for training. Note \\nalso that there is no need to normalize classifier outputs before stacking. \\n \\n3.6 Probabilistic Learning \\nIn machine learning, a probabilistic classifier is a classifier that is able to predict, given an \\nobservation of an input, a probability distribution over a set of classes, rather than only outputting the \\nmost likely class that the observation should belong to. Probabilistic classifiers provide classification \\nthat can be useful in its own right or when combining classifiers into ensembles. \\n \\nOne criticism that is often made of neural networks—especially the MLP—is that it is not clear exactly \\nwhat it is doing: while we can go and have a look at the activations of the neurons and the weights, they \\ndon’t tell us much.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 78}, page_content='74 \\n \\nIn this topic (probabilistic classifier ) we are going to look at methods that are based on statistics, and \\nthat are therefore more transparent, in that we can always extract and look at the probabilities and see \\nwhat they are, rather than having to worry about weights that have no obvious meaning. \\n \\n \\n3.7 GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELS \\nHowever, suppose that we have the same data, but without target labels. This requires \\nunsupervised learning,  Suppose that the different classes each come from their own Gaussian \\ndistribution. This is known as multi-modal data, since there is one distribution (mode) for each different \\nclass. We can’t fit one Gaussian to the data, because it doesn’t look Gaussian overall. \\n \\nThere is, however, something we can do. If we know how many classes there are in the data, \\nthen we can try to estimate the parameters for that many Gaussians, all at once. If we don’t know, then \\nwe can try different numbers and see which one works best. We will talk about this issue more for a \\ndifferent method (the k-means algorithm) in Unit 2. It is perfectly possible to use any other probability \\ndistribution instead of a Gaussian, but Gaussians are by far the most common choice. Then the output \\nfor any particular datapoint that is input to the algorithm will be the sum of the values expected by all \\nof the M Gaussians: \\n \\n \\nwhere _(x ; μm,  𝑚) is a Gaussian function with mean μm and covariance matrix  𝑚, and the  αm are \\nweights with the constraint that  \\n𝛼𝑚 \\n𝑀\\n𝑚=1\\n =1. \\n \\nThe given figures 4 shows two examples, where the data (shown by the histograms) comes from two \\ndifferent Gaussians, and the model is computed as a sum or mixture of the two Gaussians together.  \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 4: Histograms of training data from a mixture of two Gaussians and two fitted models, shown as \\nthe line plot. The model shown on the left fits well, but the one on the right produces two Gaussians \\nright on top of each other that do not fit the data well. \\n \\n \\nThe figure also gives you some idea of how to use the mixture model once it has been created. The \\nprobability that input xi belongs to class m can be written as (where a hat on a variable (ˆ·) means that \\nwe are estimating the value of that variable): \\n \\nThe problem is how to choose the weights αm. The common approach is to aim for the maximum'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 79}, page_content='75 \\n \\nlikelihood solution (the likelihood is the conditional probability of the data given the model, and the \\nmaximum likelihood solution varies the model to maximise this conditional probability). In fact, it is \\ncommon to compute the log likelihood and then to maximise that; it is guaranteed to be negative, since \\nprobabilities are all less than 1, and the logarithm spreads out the values, making the optimisation more \\neffective. The algorithm that is used is an example of a very general one known as the expectation-\\nmaximisation (or more compactly, EM) algorithm. \\n \\n3.8 The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) Algorithm \\nThe basic idea of the EM algorithm is that sometimes it is easier to add extra variables that are \\nnot actually known (called hidden or latent variables) and then to maximise the function over those \\nvariables. This might seem to be making a problem much more complicated than it needs to be, but it \\nturns out for many problems that it makes finding the solution significantly easier. \\nIn order to see how it works, we will consider the simplest interesting case of the Gaussian \\nmixture model: a combination of just two Gaussian mixtures. The assumption now is that sample from \\nthat Gaussian. If the probability of picking Gaussian one is p, then the entire model looks like this \\n(where N(μ, σ2) specifies a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ): \\n \\n \\n \\nIf the probability distribution of p is written as π, then the probability density is: \\n \\n \\n \\nFinding the maximum likelihood solution (actually the maximum log likelihood) to this problem \\nis then a case of computing the sum of the logarithm of Equation  over all of the training data, and \\ndifferentiating it, which would be rather difficult. Fortunately, there is a way around it. The key insight \\nthat we need is that if we knew which of the two Gaussian components the datapoint came from, then \\nthe computation would be easy. The mean and standard deviation for each component could be \\ncomputed from the datapoints that belong to that component, and there would not be a problem. \\nAlthough we don’t know which component each datapoint came from, we can pretend we do, by \\nintroducing a new variable f. If f = 0 then the data came from Gaussian one, if f = 1 then it came from \\nGaussian two. \\n \\nThis is the typical initial step of an EM algorithm: adding latent variables. Now we just need to \\nwork out how to optimise over them. This is the time when the reason for the algorithm being called \\nexpectation-maximisation becomes clear.We don’t know much about variable f (hardly surprising, since \\nwe invented it), but we can compute its expectation (that is, the value that we ‘expect’ to see, which is \\nthe mean average) from the data: \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere D denotes the data. Note that since we have set f = 1 this means that we are choosing Gaussian \\ntwo.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 80}, page_content='76 \\n \\n \\nComputing the value of this expectation is known as the E-step. Then this estimate of the \\nexpectation is maximised over the model parameters (the parameters of the two Gaussians and the \\nmixing parameter π), the M-step. This requires differentiating the expectation with respect to each of \\nthe model parameters. These two steps are simply iterated until the algorithm converges. Note that the \\nestimate never gets any smaller, and it turns out that EM algorithms are guaranteed to reach a local \\nmaxima. To see how this looks for the two-component Gaussian mixture, we’ll take a closer look at the \\nalgorithm: \\n \\n \\nThe trick with applying EM algorithms to problems is in identifying the correct latent variables \\nto include, and then simply working through the steps. They are very powerful methods for a wide \\nvariety of statistical learning problems. We are now going to turn our attention to something much \\nsimpler, which is how we can use information about nearby datapoints to decide on classification \\noutput. For this we don’t use a model of the data at all, but directly use the data that is available. \\n \\n3.9 Information Criteria \\nwe introduced the idea of a validation set, or using cross-validation if there was not enough \\ndata. However, this replaces data with computation time, as many models are trained on different \\ndatasets. \\n \\nAn alternative idea is to identify some measure that tells us about how well we can expect this \\ntrained model to perform. Probabilistic model selection (or “information criteria”) provides an \\nanalytical technique for scoring and choosing among candidate models. Models are scored both on \\ntheir performance on the training dataset and based on the complexity of the model.There are two \\nsuch information criteria that are commonly used: \\n \\n \\n \\nIn these equations, k is the number of parameters in the model, N is the number of training \\nexamples, and L is the best (largest) likelihood of the model. In both cases, based on the way that they \\nare written here, the model with the largest value is taken. \\n \\n3.10 Nearest neighbour methods'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 81}, page_content='77 \\n \\nSuppose that you are in a nightclub and decide to dance. It is unlikely that you will know the \\ndance moves for the particular song that is playing, so you will probably try to work out what to do by \\nlooking at what the people close to you are doing. The first thing you could do would be just to pick the \\nperson closest to you and copy them. However, since most of the people who are in the nightclub are \\nalso unlikely to know all the moves, you might decide to look at a few more people and do what most of \\nthem are doing. This is pretty much exactly the idea behind nearest neighbour methods: if we don’t \\nhave a model that describes the data, then the best thing to do is to look at similar data and choose to \\nbe in the same class as them. \\n \\nWe have the datapoints positioned within input space, so we just need to work out which of the \\ntraining data are close to it. This requires computing the distance to each datapoint in the training set, \\nwhich is relatively expensive: if we are in normal Euclidean space, then we have to compute d \\nsubtractions and d squarings (we can ignore the square root since we only want to know which points \\nare the closest, not the actual distance) and this has to be done O(N2) times. We can then identify the k \\nnearest neighbours to the test point, and then set the class of the test point to be the most common \\none out of those for the nearest neighbours. The choice of k is not trivial. Make it too small and nearest \\nneighbour methods are sensitive to noise, too large and the accuracy reduces as points that are too far \\naway are considered. Some possible effects of changing the size of k on the decision boundary are \\nshown in below Figure 5. \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 5: The nearest neighbours decision boundary with left: one neighbour and right: \\ntwo neighbours. \\n \\nThis method suffers from the curse of dimensionality. First, as shown above, the computational \\ncosts get higher as the number of dimensions grows. This is not as bad as it might appear at first: there \\nare sets of methods such as KD-Trees (will discuss in upcoming topics) that compute this in O(N log N) \\ntime. However, more importantly, as the number of dimensions increases, so the distance to other \\ndatapoints tends to increase. In addition, they can be far away in a variety of different directions—there \\nmight be points that are relatively close in some dimensions, but a long way in others. There are \\nmethods for dealing with these problems, known as adaptive nearest neighbour methods, and there is a \\nreference to them in the Further Reading section at the end of the chapter. \\n \\nThe only part of this that requires any care during the implementation is what to do when there \\nis more than one class found in the closest points, but even with that the implementation is nice and \\nsimple:'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 82}, page_content='78 \\n \\n \\n \\nWe are going to look next at how we can use these methods for regression, before we turn to the \\nquestion of how to perform the distance calculations as efficiently as possible, something that is done \\nsimply but inefficiently in the code above.

Fortunately, as with many problems in computer science, designing an \\nefficient data structure can reduce the computational overhead a lot. For the problem of finding \\nnearest neighbours the data structure of choice is the KD-Tree. It has been around since the late 1970s, \\nwhen it was devised by Friedman and Bentley, and it reduces the cost of finding a nearest neighbour to \\nO(log N) for O(N) storage. The construction of the tree is O(N log2 N), with much of the computational \\ncost being in the computation of the median, which with a naïve algorithm requires a sort and is \\ntherefore O(N log N), or can be computed with a randomised algorithm in O(N) time. \\n \\nThe idea behind the KD-tree is very simple. You create a binary tree by choosing one dimension \\nat a time to split into two, and placing the line through the median of the point coordinates of that \\ndimension. The points themselves end up as leaves of the tree. Making the tree follows pretty much the \\nsame steps as usual for constructing a binary tree: we identify a place to split into two choices, left and \\nright, and then carry on down the tree. This makes it natural to write the algorithm recursively. The \\nchoice of what to split and where is what makes the KD-tree special. Just one dimension is split in each \\nstep, and the position of the split is found by computing the median of the points that are to be split in \\nthat one dimension, and putting the line there.

The algorithm below cycles \\nthrough the possible dimensions based on the depth of the tree so far, so that in two dimensions it \\nalternates horizontal and vertical splits.  \\nThe centre of the construction method is simply a recursive function that picks the axis to split \\non, finds the median value on that axis, and separates the points according to that value, which in \\nPython can be written as: \\n \\n \\n \\nSuppose that we had seven two-dimensional points to make a tree from: (5, 4), (1, 6), (6, 1), (7, 5), (2, \\n7), (2, 2), (5, 8) (as plotted in Figure 7).  \\n \\nFIGURE 7: The initial set of 2D data. \\n \\nThe algorithm will pick the first coordinate to split on initially, and the median point here is 5, so the \\nsplit is through x = 5.

However, it is not the only option, nor is it necessarily the most \\nuseful. In this section we will look at the underlying idea behind distance calculations and possible \\nalternatives. \\n \\nIf I were to ask you to find the distance between my house and the nearest shop, then your first \\nguess might involve taking a map of my town, locating my house and the shop, and using a ruler to \\nmeasure the distance between them. By careful application of the map scale you can now tell me how \\nfar it is. However, when I set out to buy some milk I’m liable to find that I have to walk rather further \\nthan you’ve told me, since the direct line that you measured would involve walking through (or over) \\nseveral houses, and some serious fence-scaling. Your ‘as the crow flies’ distance is the shortest possible \\npath, and it is the straight-line, or Euclidean, distance. You can measure it on the map by just using a \\nruler, but it essentially consists of measuring the distance in one direction (we’ll call it \\nnorth-south) and then the distance in another direction that is perpendicular to the first (let’s call it \\neast-west) and then squaring them, adding them together, and then taking the square root of that. \\nWriting that out, the Euclidean distance that we are all used to is: \\n \\n \\nwhere (x1, y1) is the location of my house in some coordinate system (say by using a GPS tracker) and \\n(x2, y2) is the location of the shop. \\n \\nIf I told you that my town was laid out on a grid block system, as is common in towns that were \\nbuilt in the interval between the invention of the motor car and the invention of innovative town \\nplanners, then you would probably use a different measure. You would measure the distance between \\nmy house and the shop in the ‘north-south’ direction and the distance in the ‘east-west’ direction, and \\nthen add the two distances together. This would correspond to the distance I actually had to walk. It is \\noften known as the city-block or Manhattan distance and looks like: \\n \\nThe point of this discussion is to show that there is more than one way to measure a distance, \\nand that they can provide radically different answers. These two different distances can be seen in \\nFigure 11. Mathematically, these distance measures are known as metrics. A metric function or norm \\ntakes two inputs and gives a scalar (the distance) back, which is positive, and 0 if and only if the two \\npoints are the same, symmetric (so that the distance \\nto the shop is the same as the distance back), and obeys the triangle inequality, which says that the \\ndistance from a to b plus the distance from b to c should not be less than the direct distance from a to c.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 88}, page_content='84 \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 10: The Euclidean and city-block distances between two points. \\n \\nMost of the data that we are going to have to analyse lives in rather more than two dimensions. \\nFortunately, the Euclidean distance that we know about generalises very well to higher dimensions (and \\nso does the city-block metric). In fact, these two measures are both instances of a class of metrics that \\nwork in any number of dimensions. The general measure is the Minkowski metric and it is written as: \\n \\n \\nIf we put k = 1 then we get the city-block distance (Equation (7.12)), and k = 2 gives the \\nEuclidean distance (Equation (7.11)). Thus, you might possibly see the Euclidean metric written as the L2 \\nnorm and the city-block distance as the L1 norm. These norms have another interesting feature. \\nRemember that we can define different averages of a set of numbers. If we define the average as the \\npoint that minimises the sum of the distance to every datapoint, then it turns out that the mean \\nminimises the Euclidean distance (the sum-of-squares distance), and the median minimises the L1 \\nmetric. \\n \\nThere are plenty of other possible metrics to choose, depending upon the dataspace. We \\ngenerally assume that the space is flat (if it isn’t, then none of these techniques work, and we don’t \\nwant to worry about that). However, it can still be beneficial to look at other metrics. Suppose that we \\nwant our classifier to be able to recognise images, for example of faces. We take a set of digital photos \\nof faces and use the pixel values as features. Then we use the nearest neighbour algorithm that we’ve \\njust seen to identify each face. Even if we ensure that all of the photos are taken fully face-on, there are \\nstill a few things that will get in the way of this method. One is that slight variations in the angle of the \\nhead (or the camera) could make a difference; another is that different distances between the face and \\nthe camera (scaling) will change the results; and another is that different lighting conditions will make a \\ndifference. We can try to fix all of these things in preprocessing, but there is also another alternative: \\nuse a different metric that is invariant to these changes, i.e., it does not vary as they do. The idea of \\ninvariant metrics is to find measures that ignore changes that you don’t want. So if you want to be able \\nto rotate shapes around and still recognize them, you need a metric that is invariant to rotation. \\n \\nA common invariant metric in use for images is the tangent distance, which is an approximation \\nto the Taylor expansion in first derivatives, and works very well for small rotations and scalings; for \\nexample, it was used to halve the final error rate on nearest neighbor classification of a set of \\nhandwritten letters. Invariant metrics are an interesting topic for further study, and there is a reference \\nfor them in the Further Reading section if you are interested.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 89}, page_content='85 \\n \\nUnit IV  \\nReinforcement Learning and Evaluating Hypotheses \\n \\nIntroduction, Learning Task, Q Learning, Non deterministic Rewards and actions, temporal-\\ndifference learning, Relationship to Dynamic Programming, Active reinforcement learning, \\nGeneralization in reinforcement learning. \\nMotivation, Basics of Sampling Theory: Error Estimation and Estimating Binomial Proportions, \\nThe Binomial Distribution, Estimators, Bias, and Variance   \\n \\nReinforcement learning addresses the question of how an autonomous agent that senses and acts in its \\nenvironment can learn to choose optimal actions to achieve its goals. \\n \\n4.1. Introduction \\n\\uf0b7 \\nConsider building a learning robot. The robot, or agent, has a set of sensors to observe the state of \\nits environment, and a set of actions it can perform to alter this state.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIts task is to learn a control strategy, or policy, for choosing actions that achieve its goals.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe goals of the agent can be defined by a reward function that assigns a numerical value to each \\ndistinct action the agent may take from each distinct state.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThis reward function may be built into the robot, or known only to an external teacher who \\nprovides the reward value for each action performed by the robot.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe task of the robot is to perform sequences of actions, observe their consequences, and learn a \\ncontrol policy.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe control policy is one that, from any initial state, chooses actions that maximize the reward \\naccumulated over time by the agent.  \\nExample:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nA mobile robot may have sensors such as a camera and sonars, and actions such as \"move \\nforward\" and \"turn.\"  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe robot may have a goal of docking onto its battery charger whenever its battery level is low.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe goal of docking to the battery charger can be captured by assigning a positive reward (Eg., \\n+100) to state-action transitions that immediately result in a connection to the charger and a \\nreward of zero to every other state-action transition.  \\n \\nReinforcement Learning Problem  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAn agent interacting with its environment. The agent exists in an environment described by some \\nset of possible states S.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAgent perform any of a set of possible actions A. Each time it performs an action a, in some state st \\nthe agent receives a real-valued reward r, that indicates the immediate value of this state-action \\ntransition. This produces a sequence of states si, actions ai, and immediate rewards ri as shown in \\nthe figure.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe agent\\'s task is to learn a control policy, 𝝅: S → A, that maximizes the expected sum of these \\nrewards, with future rewards discounted exponentially by their delay.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 90}, page_content=\"86 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nReinforcement learning problem characteristics \\n \\n1. Delayed reward: The task of the agent is to learn a target function 𝜋 that maps from the current state \\ns to the optimal action a = 𝜋 (s). In reinforcement learning, training information is not available in (s, 𝜋 \\n(s)). Instead, the trainer provides only a sequence of immediate reward values as the agent executes its \\nsequence of actions. The agent, therefore, faces the problem of temporal credit assignment: \\ndetermining which of the actions in its sequence are to be credited with producing the eventual \\nrewards.  \\n \\n2. Exploration: In reinforcement learning, the agent influences the distribution of training examples by \\nthe action sequence it chooses. This raises the question of which experimentation strategy produces \\nmost effective learning. The learner faces a trade-off in choosing whether to favor exploration of \\nunknown states and actions, or exploitation of states and actions that it has already learned will yield \\nhigh reward.  \\n \\n3. Partially observable states: The agent's sensors can perceive the entire state of the environment at \\neach time step, in many practical situations sensors provide only partial information. In such cases, the \\nagent needs to consider its previous observations together with its current sensor data when choosing \\nactions, and the best policy may be one that chooses actions specifically to improve the observability of \\nthe environment.  \\n \\n4. Life-long learning: Robot requires to learn several related tasks within the same environment, using \\nthe same sensors. For example, a mobile robot may need to learn how to dock on its battery charger, \\nhow to navigate through narrow corridors, and how to pick up output from laser printers. This setting \\nraises the possibility of using previously obtained experience or knowledge to reduce sample complexity \\nwhen learning new tasks.  \\n \\n4.2. Learning Task \\n\\uf0b7 \\nConsider Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent can perceive a set S of distinct states of \\nits environment and has a set A of actions that it can perform.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAt each discrete time step t, the agent senses the current state st, chooses a current action at, and \\nperforms it.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 91}, page_content='87 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe environment responds by giving the agent a reward rt = r(st, at) and by producing the \\nsucceeding state st+l = δ(st, at). Here the functions δ(st, at) and r(st, at) depend only on the current \\nstate and action, and not on earlier states or actions.  \\n \\nThe task of the agent is to learn a policy, 𝝅: S → A, for selecting its next action a, based on the current \\nobserved state st; that is, (st) = at.  \\n \\nHow shall we specify precisely which policy π we would like the agent to learn? \\n \\n1. One approach is to require the policy that produces the greatest possible cumulative reward for the \\nrobot over time.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTo state this requirement more precisely, define the cumulative value Vπ (st) achieved by following \\nan arbitrary policy π from an arbitrary initial state st as follows:  \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWhere, the sequence of rewards rt+i is generated by beginning at state st and by repeatedly using \\nthe policy π to select actions.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHere 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is a constant that determines the relative value of delayed versus immediate \\nrewards. if we set γ = 0, only the immediate reward is considered. As we set γ closer to 1, future \\nrewards are given greater emphasis relative to the immediate reward.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe quantity Vπ (st) is called the discounted cumulative reward achieved by policy π from initial \\nstate s. It is reasonable to discount future rewards relative to immediate rewards because, in many \\ncases, we prefer to obtain the reward sooner rather than later.  \\n \\n2. Other definitions of total reward is finite horizon reward,  \\n \\n \\nConsiders the undiscounted sum of rewards over a finite number h of steps  \\n \\n3.

Evaluating Hypotheses \\n4.2.1. Motivation  \\nIt is important to evaluate the performance of learned hypotheses as precisely as possible.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nOne reason is simply to understand whether to use the hypothesis.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nA second reason is that evaluating hypotheses is an integral component of many learning \\nmethods.  \\n \\nTwo key difficulties arise while learning a hypothesis and estimating its future accuracy given only a \\nlimited set of data:  \\n \\n1. Bias in the estimate. The observed accuracy of the learned hypothesis over the training examples is \\noften a poor estimator of its accuracy over future examples. Because the learned hypothesis was \\nderived from these examples, they will typically provide an optimistically biased estimate of hypothesis \\naccuracy over future examples.

Motivation \\nGenetic algorithms (GAS) provide a learning method motivated by an analogy to biological \\nevolution. Rather than search from general-to-specific hypotheses, or from simple-to-complex, GAS \\ngenerate successor hypotheses by repeatedly mutating and recombining parts of the best currently \\nknown hypotheses. At each step, a collection of hypotheses called the current population is updated by \\nreplacing some fraction of the population by offspring of the most fit current hypotheses. The process \\nforms a generate-and-test beam-search of hypotheses, in which variants of the best current hypotheses \\nare most likely to be considered next. The popularity of GAS is motivated by a number of factors \\nincluding: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nEvolution is known to be a successful, robust method for adaptation within biological systems. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGAS can search spaces of hypotheses containing complex interacting parts, where the impact of \\neach part on overall hypothesis fitness may be difficult to model. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGenetic algorithms are easily parallelized and can take advantage of the decreasing costs of \\npowerful computer hardware. \\n \\n9.2 Genetic Algorithms \\nThe problem addressed by GAS is to search a space of candidate hypotheses to identify the best \\nhypothesis. In GAS the \"best hypothesis\" is defined as the one that optimizes a predefined numerical \\nmeasure for the problem at hand, called b the hypothesis fitness. For example, if the learning task is the \\nproblem of approximating an unknown function given training examples of its input and output, then \\nfitness could be defined as the accuracy of the hypothesis over this training data. If the task is to learn a \\nstrategy for playing chess, fitness could be defined as the number of games won by the individual when \\nplaying against other individuals in the current population. \\nAlthough different implementations of genetic algorithms vary in their details, they typically share the \\nfollowing structure: The algorithm operates by iteratively updating a pool of hypotheses, called the \\npopulation. On each iteration, all members of the population are evaluated according to the fitness \\nfunction. A new population is then generated by probabilistically selecting the fit individuals from the \\ncurrent population. Some of these selected individuals are carried forward into the next generation \\npopulation intact. Others are used as the basis for creating new offspring individuals by applying genetic \\noperations such as crossover and mutation.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 105}, page_content='101 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe inputs to this algorithm include the fitness function for ranking candidate hypotheses, a \\nthreshold defining an acceptable level of fitness for terminating the algorithm, the size of the \\npopulation to be maintained, and parameters that determine how successor populations are to be \\ngenerated: the fraction of the population to be replaced at each generation and the mutation rate. \\nNotice in this algorithm each iteration through the main loop produces a new generation of hypotheses \\nbased on the current population. First, a certain number of hypotheses from the current population are \\nselected for inclusion in the next generation. These are selected probabilistically, where the probability \\nof selecting hypothesis hi is given by  \\n \\nThus, the probability that a hypothesis will be selected is proportional to its own fitness and is \\ninversely proportional to the fitness of the other competing hypotheses in the current population. \\nOnce these members of the current generation have been selected for inclusion in the next generation \\npopulation, additional members are generated using a crossover operation. Crossover, defined in detail \\nin the next section, takes two parent hypotheses from the current generation and creates two offspring \\nhypotheses \\nby recombining portions of both parents.

At this point, a certain fraction m of these members are chosen at \\nrandom, and random mutations all performed to alter these members. \\n \\n \\nThis GA algorithm thus performs a randomized, parallel beam search for hypotheses that perform well \\naccording to the fitness function. In the following subsections, we describe in more detail the \\nrepresentation of hypotheses and genetic operators used in this algorithm. \\n \\nRepresenting Hypotheses \\nHypotheses in GAS are often represented by bit strings, so that they can be easily manipulated \\nby genetic operators such as mutation and crossover. The hypotheses represented by these bit strings \\ncan be quite complex. For example, sets of if-then rules can easily be represented in this way, by \\nchoosing an encoding of rules that allocates specific substrings for each rule precondition and \\npostcondition. \\nTo see how if-then rules can be encoded by bit strings, .first consider how we might use a bit \\nstring to describe a constraint on the value of a single attribute. To pick an example, consider the \\nattribute Outlook, which can take on any of the three values Sunny, Overcast, or Rain. One obvious way \\nto represent a constraint on Outlook is to use a bit string of length three, in which each bit position \\ncorresponds to one of its three possible values. Placing a 1 in some position indicates that the attribute \\nis allowed to take on the corresponding value. For example, the string 010 represents the constraint \\nthat Outlook must take on the second of these values, or Outlook = Overcast. Similarly, the string 011 \\nrepresents the more general constraint that allows two possible values, or (Outlook = Overcast v Rain). \\nNote 11 1 represents the most general possible constraint, indicating that we don\\'t care which of its \\npossible values the attribute takes on. \\nGiven this method for representing constraints on a single attribute, conjunctions of constraints \\non multiple attributes can easily be represented by concatenating the corresponding bit strings. For \\nexample, consider a second attribute, Wind, that can take on the value Strong or Weak. A rule \\nprecondition such as  \\n \\n(Outlook = Overcast ^Rain) A (Wind = Strong) \\n \\ncan then be represented by the following bit string of length five: \\n \\n    Outlook    Wind \\n01 1 \\n     10 \\n \\nRule postconditions (such as PlayTennis = yes) can be represented in a similar fashion. Thus, an entire \\nrule can be described by concatenating the bit strings describing the rule preconditions, together with \\nthe bit string describing the rule postcondition. For example, the rule \\n \\nIF Wind = Strong THEN PlayTennis = yes \\n \\nwould be represented by the string \\n \\n    Outlook    Wind    PlayTennis \\n111  \\n    10 \\n    10 \\n \\nwhere the first three bits describe the \"don\\'t care\" constraint on Outlook, the next two bits describe the \\nconstraint on Wind, and the final two bits describe the rule postcondition (here we assume PlayTennis'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 107}, page_content='103 \\n \\ncan take on the values Yes or No). Note the bit string representing the rule contains a substring for each \\nattribute in the hypothesis space, even if that attribute is not constrained by the rule preconditions. This \\nyields a fixed length bit-string representation for rules, in which substrings at specific locations describe \\nconstraints on specific attributes. Given this representation for single rules, we can represent sets of \\nrules by similarly concatenating the bit string representations of the individual rules. \\n \\n \\nIn designing a bit string encoding for some hypothesis space, it is useful to arrange for every \\nsyntactically legal bit string to represent a well-defined hypothesis. To illustrate, note in the rule \\nencoding in the above paragraph the bit string 11 1 10 11 represents a rule whose postcondition does \\nnot constrain the target attribute PlayTennis. If we wish to avoid considering this hypothesis, we may \\nemploy a different encoding (e.g., allocate just one bit to the PlayTennis postcondition to indicate \\nwhether the value is Yes or No), alter the genetic operators so that they explicitly avoid constructing \\nsuch bit strings, or simply assign a very low fitness to such bit strings. \\n \\nIn some GAS, hypotheses are represented by symbolic descriptions rather than bit strings.  \\n \\nGenetic Operators \\nThe generation of successors in a GA is determined by a set of operators that recombine and \\nmutate selected members of the current population. These operators correspond to idealized versions \\nof the genetic operations found in biological evolution. The two most common operators are crossover \\nand mutation. \\nThe crossover operator produces two new offspring from two parent strings, by copying \\nselected bits from each parent. The bit at position i in each offspring is copied from the bit at position i \\nin one of the two parents. The choice of which parent contributes the bit for position i is determined by \\nan additional string called the crossover mask. To illustrate, consider the single-point crossover \\noperator at the top of Table Consider the topmost of the two offspring in this case. This offspring takes \\nits first five bits from the first parent and its remaining six bits from the second parent, because the \\ncrossover mask 11 11 1000000 specifies these choices for each of the bit positions. The second offspring \\nuses the same crossover mask, but switches the roles of the two parents. Therefore, it contains the bits \\nthat were not used by the first offspring. In single-point crossover, the crossover mask is always \\nconstructed so that it begins with a string containing n contiguous Is, followed by the necessary number \\nof 0s to complete the string. This results in offspring in which the first n bits are contributed by one \\nparent and the remaining bits by the second parent. Each time the single-point crossover operator is \\napplied the crossover point n is chosen at random, and the crossover mask is then created and applied.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 108}, page_content='104 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn two-point crossover, offspring are created by substituting intermediate segments of one parent into \\nthe middle of the second parent string. Put another way, the crossover mask is a string beginning with \\nno zeros, followed by a contiguous string of nl ones, followed by the necessary number of zeros to \\ncomplete the string. Each time the two-point crossover operator is applied, a mask is generated by \\nrandomly choosing the integers no and nl.  \\n \\nFitness Function and Selection \\nThe fitness function defines the criterion for ranking potential hypotheses and for \\nprobabilistically selecting them for inclusion in the next generation population. If the task is to learn \\nclassification rules, then the fitness function typically has a component that scores the classification \\naccuracy of the rule over a set of provided training examples. Often other criteria may be included as \\nwell, such as the complexity or generality of the rule. More generally, when the bit-string hypothesis is \\ninterpreted as a complex procedure (e.g., when the bit string represents a collection of if-then rules that \\nwill be chained together to control a robotic device), the fitness function may measure the overall \\nperformance of the resulting procedure rather than performance of individual rules. \\nIn our prototypical GA shown in above Table , the probability that a hypothesis will be selected is given \\nby the ratio of its fitness to the fitness of other members of the current population as seen in Equation \\nabove . This method is sometimes called fitness proportionate selection, or roulette wheel selection. \\nOther methods for using fitness to select hypotheses have also been proposed. For example, in \\ntournament selection, two hypotheses are first chosen at random from the current population. With \\nsome predefined probability p the more fit of these two is then selected, and with probability (1 - p) the \\nless fit hypothesis is selected. Tournament selection often yields a more diverse population than fitness \\nproportionate selection. In another method called rank selection, the hypotheses in the current \\npopulation are first sorted by fitness. The probability that a hypothesis will be selected is then \\nproportional to its rank in this sorted list, rather than its fitness.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 109}, page_content=\"105 \\n \\n \\n5.3. An Illustrative Example \\nA genetic algorithm can be viewed as a general optimization method that searches a large space \\nof candidate objects seeking one that performs best according to the fitness function. Although not \\nguaranteed to find an optimal object, GAS often succeed in finding an object with high fitness. GAS have \\nbeen applied to a number of optimization problems outside machine learning, including problems such \\nas circuit layout and job-shop scheduling. Within machine learning, they have been applied both to \\nfunction-approximation problems and to tasks such as choosing the network topology for artificial \\nneural network learning systems. \\nTo illustrate the use of GAS for concept learning, we briefly summarize the GABIL system \\ndescribed by DeJong et al. (1993). GABIL uses a GA to learn boolean concepts represented by a \\ndisjunctive set of propositional rules. In experiments over several concept learning problems, GABIL was \\nfound to be roughly comparable in generalization accuracy to other learning algorithms such as the \\ndecision tree learning algorithm C4.5 and the rule learning system AQ14. The learning tasks in this study \\nincluded both artificial learning tasks designed to explore the systems' generalization accuracy and the \\nreal world problem of breast cancer diagnosis. \\nThe specific instantiation of the GA algorithm in GABIL can be summarized as follows: \\nRepresentation. Each hypothesis in GABIL corresponds to a disjunctive set of propositional rules, \\nencoded as described in Section 9.2.1. In particular, the hypothesis space of rule preconditions consists \\nof a conjunction of constraints on a fixed set of attributes, as described in that earlier section. To \\nrepresent a set of rules, the bit-string representations of individual rules are concatenated. To illustrate, \\nconsider a hypothesis space in which rule preconditions are conjunctions of constraints over two \\nBoolean attributes, a1 and a2.The rule postcondition is described by a single bit that indicates the \\npredicted value of the target attribute c. Thus, the hypothesis consisting of the two rules \\n \\nIF al=T^a2=F THEN c=T; IF a2=T THEN c=F \\n \\n \\nwould be represented by the string \\n \\na1   a2   c   \\na1   a2   c \\n10  01  1 \\n11  01 0 \\n \\nNote the length of the bit string grows with the number of rules in the hypothesis.

In particular, to \\naccommodate the variable-length bit strings that encode rule sets, and to constrain the system so that \\ncrossover occurs only between like sections of the bit strings that encode rules, the following approach \\nis taken. To perform a crossover operation on two parents, two crossover points are first chosen at \\nrandom in the first parent string. Let dl (dz) denote the distance from the leftmost (rightmost) of these \\ntwo crossover points to the rule boundary immediately to its left.

The first of \\nthese operators,  AddAlternative, generalizes the constraint on a specific attribute by changing a 0 to a \\n1 in the substring corresponding to the attribute. For example, if the constraint on an attribute is \\nrepresented by the string 10010, this operator might change it to 101 10. This operator was applied \\nwith probability .O1 to selected members of the population on each generation. The second operator, \\nDropcondition performs a more drastic generalization step, by replacing all bits for a particular attribute \\nby a 1. This operator corresponds to generalizing the rule by completely dropping the constraint on the \\nattribute, and was applied on each generation with probability .60. The authors report this revised \\nsystem achieved an average performance of 95.2% over the above set of synthetic learning tasks, \\ncompared to 92.1% for the basic GA algorithm. \\n \\nIn the above experiment, the two new operators were applied with the same probability to each \\nhypothesis in the population on each generation. In a second experiment, the bit-string representation \\nfor hypotheses was extended to include two bits that determine which of these operators may be \\napplied to the hypothesis. In this extended representation, the bit string for a typical rule set hypothesis \\nwould be  \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere the final two bits indicate in this case that the AddAlternative operator may be applied to this bit \\nstring, but that the Dropcondition operator may not. These two new bits define part of the search \\nstrategy used by the GA and are themselves altered and evolved using the same crossover and mutation \\noperators that operate on other bits in the string. While the authors report mixed results with this \\napproach (i.e., improved performance on some problems, decreased performance on others), it \\nprovides an interesting illustration of how GAS might in principle be used to evolve their own \\nhypothesis search methods. \\n \\n5.4 Hypothesis Space Search \\nAs illustrated above, GAS employ a randomized beam search method to seek a maximally fit hypothesis. \\nThis search is quite different from that of other learning methods we have considered in this book. To \\ncontrast the hypothesis space search of GAS with that of neural network BACKPROPAGATION, for \\nexample, the radiant descent search in BACKPROPAGATION moves smoothly from one hypothesis to a \\nnew hypothesis that is very similar. In contrast, the GA search can move much more abruptly, replacing \\na parent hypothesis by an offspring that may be radically different from the parent. Note the GA search \\nis therefore less likely to fall into the same kind of local minima that can plague gradient descent \\nmethods.  \\nOne practical difficulty in some GA applications is the problem of crowding. Crowding is a phenomenon \\nin which some individual that is more highly fit than others in the population quickly reproduces, so that \\ncopies of this individual and very similar individuals take over a large fraction of the population. The \\nnegative impact of crowding is that it reduces the diversity of the population, thereby slowing further \\nprogress by the GA. Several strategies have been explored for reducing crowding. One approach is to \\nalter the selection function, using criteria such as tournament selection or rank selection in place of \\nfitness proportionate roulette wheel selection. A related strategy is \"fitness sharing,\" in which the \\nmeasured fitness of an individual is reduced by the presence of other, similar individuals in the \\npopulation. A third approach is to restrict the kinds of individuals allowed to recombine to form \\noffspring. For example, by allowing only the most similar individuals to recombine, we can encourage'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 112}, page_content='108 \\n \\nthe formation of clusters of similar individuals, or multiple \"subspecies\" within the population. A related \\napproach is to spatially distribute individuals and allow only nearby individuals to recombine. Many of \\nthese techniques are inspired by the analogy to biological evolution. \\n \\nPopulation Evolution and the Schema Theorem \\nIt is interesting to ask whether one can mathematically characterize the evolution over time of the \\npopulation within a GA. The schema theorem provides one such characterization. It is based on the \\nconcept of schemas, or patterns that describe sets of bit strings. To be precise, a schema is any string \\ncomposed of 0s, 1s, and *\\'s. Each schema represents the set of bit strings containing the indicated 0s \\nand 1s, with each “*” interpreted as a \"don\\'t care.\" For example, the schema 0*10 represents the set of \\nbit strings that includes exactly 0010 and 01 10. \\nAn individual bit string can be viewed as a representative of each of the different schemas that it \\nmatches. For example, the bit string 0010 can be thought of as a representative of 24 distinct schemas \\nincluding 00**, 0* 10, ****, etc. Similarly, a population of bit strings can be viewed in terms of the set \\nof schemas that it represents and the number of individuals associated with each of these schema.  \\nThe schema theorem characterizes the evolution of the population within a GA in terms of the number \\nof instances representing each schema. Let m(s, t) denote the number of instances of schema s in the \\npopulation at time t (i.e., during the tth generation). The schema theorem describes the expected value \\nof m(s,t+1) in terms of m(s, t) and other properties of the schema, population, and GA algorithm \\nparameters. \\nThe evolution of the population in the GA depends on the selection step, the recombination step, and \\nthe mutation step. Let us start by considering just the effect of the selection step. Let f (h) denote the \\nfitness of the individual bit string h and \\n\\uf028\\uf029t\\nf\\n\\uf04b\\ndenote the average fitness of all individuals in the \\npopulation at time t. Let n be the total number of individuals in the population. Let \\npt\\ns\\nh\\n\\uf0c7\\n\\uf065\\n, indicate \\nthat the individual h is both a representative of schema s and a member of the population at time t. \\nFinally, let \\uf028\\n\\uf029t\\ns\\nu ,\\n\\uf0d9\\ndenote the average fitness of instances of schema s in the population at time t. \\nWe are interested in calculating the expected value of m(s,t+1), which we denote E[m(s,t+1)]. We can \\ncalculate E[m(s,t+1)] using the probability distribution for selection given in Equation, which can be \\nrestated using our current terminology as follows \\n \\nNow if we select one member for the new population according to this probability distribution, then the \\nprobability that we will select a representative of schema s is'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 113}, page_content=\"109 \\n \\n \\nThe second step above follows from the fact that by definition, \\n \\n \\n \\nEquation gives the probability that a single hypothesis selected by the GA will be an instance of schema \\ns. Therefore, the expected number of instances of s resulting from the n independent selection steps \\nthat create the entire new generation is just n times this probability. \\n \\n \\n \\nEquation states that the expected number of instances of schema s at generation t+1 is proportional to \\nthe average fitness \\uf028\\n\\uf029t\\ns\\nu ,\\n\\uf0d9\\n of instances of this schema at time t , and inversely proportional to the \\naverage fitness \\n\\uf028\\uf029t\\nf\\n\\uf04b\\n of all members of the population at time t. Thus, we can expect schemas with \\nabove average fitness to be represented with increasing frequency on successive generations. If we \\nview the GA as performing a virtual parallel search through the space of possible schemas at the same \\ntime it performs its explicit parallel search through the space of individuals, then Equation indicates that \\nmore fit schemas will grow in influence over time.  \\nWhile the above analysis considered only the selection step of the GA, the crossover and mutation \\nsteps must be considered as well. The schema theorem considers only the possible negative influence \\nof these genetic operators (e.g., random mutation may decrease the number of representatives of s, \\nindependent of \\uf028\\n\\uf029t\\ns\\nu ,\\n\\uf0d9\\n and considers only the case of single-point crossover. The full schema theorem \\nthus provides a lower bound on the expected frequency of schema s, as follows: \\n \\n \\nHere, pc is the probability that the single-point crossover operator will be applied \\nto an arbitrary individual, and pm, is the probability that an arbitrary bit of an arbitrary individual will be \\nmutated by the mutation operator. o(s) is the number of defined bits in schema s, where 0 and 1 are \\ndefined bits, but * is not. d(s) is the distance between the leftmost and rightmost defined bits in s. \\nFinally, l is the length of the individual bit strings in the population. Notice the leftmost term in Equation \\nis identical to the term from Equation and describes the effect of the selection step. The middle term \\ndescribes the effect of the single-point crossover operator-in particular, it describes the probability that \\nan arbitrary individual representing s will still represent s following application of this crossover \\noperator. The rightmost term describes the probability that an arbitrary individual representing schema \\ns will still represent schema s following application of the mutation operator. Note that the effects of \\nsingle-point crossover and mutation increase with the number of defined bits o(s) in the schema and \\nwith the distance d(s) between the defined bits. Thus, the schema theorem can be roughly interpreted \\nas stating that more fit schemas will tend to grow in influence, especially schemas containing a small \\nnumber of defined bits (i.e., containing a large number of *'s), and especially when these defined bits\"), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 114}, page_content='110 \\n \\nare near one another within the bit string. The schema theorem is perhaps the most widely cited \\ncharacterization of population evolution within a GA. One way in which it is incomplete is that it fails to \\nconsider the (presumably) positive effects of crossover and mutation. Numerous more recent \\ntheoretical analyses have been proposed, including analyses based on Markov chain models and on \\nstatistical mechanics models. \\n \\n5.5 GENETIC PROGRAMMING \\nGenetic programming (GP) is a form of evolutionary computation in which the individuals in the \\nevolving population are computer programs rather than bit strings. The basic genetic programming \\napproach and presents a broad range of simple programs that can be successfully learned by GP.  \\n \\nRepresenting Programs \\nPrograms manipulated by a GP are typically represented by trees corresponding to the parse tree of the \\nprogram. Each function call is represented by a node in the tree, and the arguments to the function are \\ngiven by its descendant nodes. For example, below Figure illustrates this tree representation for the \\nfunction sin(x) + \\uf028\\n\\uf029\\ny\\nx \\uf02b\\n2\\n. To apply genetic programming to a particular domain, the user must define \\nthe primitive functions to be considered (e.g., sin, cos, \\n, +, -, exponential~), as well as the terminals \\n(e.g., x, y, constants such as 2). The genetic programming algorithm then uses an evolutionary search to \\nexplore the vast space of programs that can be described using these primitives. As in a genetic \\nalgorithm, the prototypical genetic programming algorithm maintains a population of individuals (in this \\ncase, program trees). On each iteration, it produces a new generation of individuals using selection, \\ncrossover, and mutation. The fitness of a given individual program in the population is typically \\ndetermined by executing the program on a set of training data. Crossover operations are performed by \\nreplacing a randomly chosen subtree of one parent program by a subtree from the other parent \\nprogram.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 115}, page_content='111 \\n \\n \\n \\nAbove Figure  illustrates a typical crossover operation. It describes a set of experiments applying \\na GP to a number of applications. In his experiments, 10% of the current population, selected \\nprobabilistically according to fitness, is retained unchanged in the next generation. The remainder of \\nthe new generation is created by applying crossover to pairs of programs from the current generation, \\nagain selected probabilistically according to their fitness. The mutation operator was not used in this \\nparticular set of experiments. \\n \\nIllustrative Example \\nOne illustrative example presented by Koza (1992) involves learning an algorithm for stacking the blocks \\nshown in below Figure The task is to develop a general algorithm for stacking the blocks into a single \\nstack that spells the word \"universal,\" independent of the initial configuration of blocks in the world. \\nThe actions available for manipulating blocks allow moving only a single block at a time. In particular, \\nthe top block on the stack can be moved to the table surface, or a block on the table surface can be \\nmoved to the top of the stack.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 116}, page_content='112 \\n \\n \\n \\nAs in most GP applications, the choice of problem representation has a significant impact on the \\nease of solving the problem. In Koza\\'s formulation, the primitive functions used to compose programs \\nfor this task include the following three terminal arguments: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCS (current stack), which refers to the name of the top block on the stack, or F if there is no \\ncurrent stack. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTB (top correct block), which refers to the name of the topmost block on the stack, such that it \\nand those blocks beneath it are in the correct order. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nNN (next necessary), which refers to the name of the next block needed above TB in the stack, \\nin order to spell the word \"universal,\" or F if no more blocks are needed.  \\n \\nAs can be seen, this particular choice of terminal arguments provides a natural representation for \\ndescribing programs for manipulating blocks for this task. Imagine, in contrast, the relative difficulty of \\nthe task if we were to instead define the terminal arguments to be the x and y coordinates of each \\nblock. \\nIn addition to these terminal arguments, the program language in this application included the \\nfollowing primitive functions:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(MS x) (move to stack), if block x is on the table, this operator moves x to the top of the stack \\nand returns the value T. Otherwise, it does nothing and returns the value F. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(MT x) (move to table), if block x is somewhere in the stack, this moves the block at the top of \\nthe stack to the table and returns the value T. Otherwise, it returns the value F. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(EQ x y) (equal), which returns T if x equals y, and returns F otherwise. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(NOT x), which returns T if x = F, and returns F if x = T. \\n\\uf0b7 \\n(DU x y) (do until), which executes the expression x repeatedly until expressiony returns the \\nvalue T. \\n \\nTo allow the system to evaluate the fitness of any given program, Koza provided a set of 166 training \\nexample problems representing a broad variety of initial block configurations, including problems of \\ndiffering degrees of difficulty. The fitness of any given program was taken to be the number of these \\nexamples solved by the algorithm. The population was initialized to a set of 300 random programs. \\nAfter 10 generations, the system discovered the following program, which solves all 166 problems. \\n \\n(EQ (DU (MT CS)(NOT CS)) (DU (MS NN)(NOT NN)) ) \\n \\nNotice this program contains a sequence of two DU, or \"Do Until\" statements. The first repeatedly'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 117}, page_content='113 \\n \\nmoves the current top of the stack onto the table, until the stack becomes empty. The second \"Do \\nUntil\" statement then repeatedly moves the next necessary block from the table onto the stack. The \\nrole played by the top level EQ expression here is to provide a syntactically legal way to sequence these \\ntwo \"Do Until\" loops. \\nSomewhat surprisingly, after only a few generations, this GP was able to discover a program that solves \\nall 166 training problems. Of course the ability of the system to accomplish this depends strongly on the \\nprimitive arguments and functions provided, and on the set of training example cases used to evaluate \\nfitness. \\n \\nRemarks on Genetic Programming \\nAs illustrated in the above example, genetic programming extends genetic algorithms to the \\nevolution of complete computer programs. Despite the huge size of the hypothesis space it must \\nsearch, genetic programming has been demonstrated to produce intriguing results in a number of \\napplications. A comparison of GP to other methods for searching through the space of computer \\nprograms, such as hillclimbing and simulated annealing, is given by O\\'Reilly and Oppacher (1994). \\nWhile the above example of GP search is fairly simple, Koza et al. (1996) summarize the use of a GP in \\nseveral more complex tasks such as designing electronic filter circuits and classifying segments of \\nprotein molecules. The filter circuit design problem provides an example of a considerably more \\ncomplex problem. Here, programs are evolved that transform a simple fixed seed circuit into a final \\ncircuit design. The primitive functions used by the GP to construct its programs are functions that edit \\nthe seed circuit by inserting or deleting circuit components and wiring connections. The fitness of each \\nprogram is calculated by simulating the circuit it outputs (using the SPICE circuit simulator) to determine \\nhow closely this circuit meets the design specifications for the desired filter. More precisely, the fitness \\nscore is the sum of the magnitudes of errors between the desired and actual circuit output at 101 \\ndifferent input frequencies. In this case, a population of size 640,000 was maintained, with selection \\nproducing 10% of the successor population, crossover producing 89%, and mutation producing 1%. The \\nsystem was executed on a 64-node parallel processor. Within the first randomly generated population, \\nthe circuits produced were so unreasonable that the SPICE simulator could not even simulate the \\nbehavior of 98% of the circuits. The percentage of unsimulatable circuits dropped to 84.9% following \\nthe first generation, to 75.0% following the second generation, and to an average of 9.6% over \\nsucceeding generations. The fitness score of the best circuit in the initial population was 159, compared \\nto a score of 39 after 20 generations and a score of 0.8 after 137 generations. The best circuit, produced \\nafter 137 generations, exhibited performance very similar to the desired behavior. \\nIn most cases, the performance of genetic programming depends crucially on the choice of \\nrepresentation and on the choice of fitness function. For this reason, an active area of current research \\nis aimed at the automatic discovery and incorporation of subroutines that improve on the original set of \\nprimitive functions, thereby allowing the system to dynamically alter the primitives from which it \\nconstructs individuals. See, for example, Koza (1994). \\n \\n5.6 Models of Evolution and Learning \\nIn many natural systems, individual organisms learn to adapt significantly during their lifetime. \\nAt the same time, biological and social processes allow their species to adapt over a time frame of many \\ngenerations. One interesting question regarding evolutionary systems is \"What is the relationship \\nbetween learning during the lifetime of a single individual, and the longer time frame species-level \\nlearning afforded by evolution?\\' \\n \\nLamarckian Evolution \\nLarnarck was a scientist who, in the late nineteenth century, proposed that evolution over many \\ngenerations was directly influenced by the experiences of individual organisms during their lifetime. In'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 118}, page_content='114 \\n \\nparticular, he proposed that experiences of a single organism directly affected the genetic makeup of \\ntheir offspring: If an individual learned during its lifetime to avoid some toxic food, it could pass this \\ntrait on genetically to its offspring, which therefore would not need to learn the trait. This is an \\nattractive conjecture, because it would presumably allow for more efficient evolutionary progress than \\na generate-and-test process (like that of GAS and GPs) that ignores the experience gained during an \\nindividual\\'s lifetime. Despite the attractiveness of this theory, current scientific evidence \\noverwhelmingly contradicts Lamarck\\'s model. The currently accepted view is that the genetic makeup \\nof an individual is, in fact, unaffected by the lifetime experience of one\\'s biological parents. Despite this \\napparent biological fact, recent computer studies have shown that Lamarckian processes can \\nsometimes improve the effectiveness of computerized genetic algorithms (see Grefenstette 1991; \\nAckley and Littman 1994; and Hart and Belew 1995). \\n \\nBaldwin Effect \\nAlthough Lamarckian evolution is not an accepted model of biological evolution, other mechanisms \\nhave been suggested by which individual learning can alter the course of evolution. One such \\nmechanism is called the Baldwin effect, after J. M. Baldwin (1896), who first suggested the idea. The \\nBaldwin effect is based on the following observations: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf a species is evolving in a changing environment, there will be evolutionary pressure to favor \\nindividuals with the capability to learn during their lifetime. For example, if a new predator \\nappears in the environment, then individuals capable of learning to avoid the predator will be \\nmore successful than individuals who cannot learn. In effect, the ability to learn allows an \\nindividual to perform a small local search during its lifetime to maximize its fitness. In contrast, \\nnonlearning individuals whose fitness is fully determined by their genetic makeup will operate \\nat a relative disadvantage. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThose individuals who are able to learn many traits will rely less strongly on their genetic code \\nto \"hard-wire\" traits. As a result, these individuals can support a more diverse gene pool, relying \\non individual learning to overcome the \"missing\" or \"not quite optimized\" traits in the genetic \\ncode. This more diverse gene pool can, in turn, support more rapid evolutionary adaptation. \\nThus, the ability of individuals to learn can have an indirect accelerating effect on the rate of \\nevolutionary adaptation for the entire population. \\n \\nTo illustrate, imagine some new change in the environment of some species, such as a new \\npredator. Such a change will selectively favor individuals capable of learning to avoid the predator. As \\nthe proportion of such self-improving individuals in the population grows, the population will be able to \\nsupport a more diverse gene pool, allowing evolutionary processes (even non-Lamarckian generate-\\nand-test processes) to adapt more rapidly. This accelerated adaptation may in turn enable standard \\nevolutionary processes to more quickly evolve a genetic (nonlearned) trait to avoid the predator (e.g., \\nan instinctive fear of this animal). Thus, the Baldwin effect provides an indirect mechanism for \\nindividual learning to positively impact the rate of evolutionary progress. By increasing survivability and \\ngenetic diversity of the species, individual learning supports more rapid evolutionary progress, thereby \\nincreasing the chance that the species will evolve genetic, nonlearned traits that better fit the new \\nenvironment.  \\nThere have been several attempts to develop computational models to study the Baldwin \\neffect. For example, Hinton and Nowlan (1987) experimented with evolving a population of simple \\nneural networks, in which some network weights were fixed during the individual network \"lifetime,\" \\nwhile others were trainable. The genetic makeup of the individual determined which weights were'), Document(metadata={'producer': '', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf/MACHINE LEARNING(R17A0534).pdf', 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 119}, page_content='115 \\n \\ntrainable and which were fixed. In their experiments, when no individual learning was allowed, the \\npopulation failed to improve its fitness over time. However, when individual learning was allowed, the \\npopulation quickly improved its fitness. During early generations of evolution the population contained \\na greater proportion of individuals with many trainable weights. However, as evolution proceeded, the \\nnumber of fixed, correct network weights tended to increase, as the population evolved toward \\ngenetically given weight values and toward less dependence on individual learning of weights. \\nAdditional computational studies of the Baldwin effect have been reported by Belew (1990), Harvey \\n(1993), and French and Messinger (1994). An excellent overview of this topic can be found in Mitchell \\n(1996). A special issue of the journal Evolutionary Computation on this topic (Turney et al. 1997) \\ncontains several articles on the Baldwin effect. \\n \\n5.7 Parallelizing Genetic Algorithms \\nGAS are naturally suited to parallel implementation, and a number of approaches to \\nparallelization have been explored. Coarse grain approaches to parallelization subdivide the population \\ninto somewhat distinct groups of individuals, called demes. Each deme is assigned to a different \\ncomputational node, and a standard GA search is performed at each node. Communication and cross-\\nfertilization between demes occurs on a less frequent basis than within demes. Transfer between \\ndemes occurs by a migration process, in which individuals from one deme are copied or transferred to \\nother demes. This process is modeled after the kind of cross-fertilization that might occur between \\nphysically separated subpopulations of biological species. One benefit of such approaches is that it \\nreduces the crowding problem often encountered in nonparallel GAS, in which the system falls into a \\nlocal optimum due to the early appearance of a genotype that comes to dominate the entire \\npopulation. Examples of coarse-grained parallel GAS are described by Tanese (1989) and by Cohoon et \\nal. (1987). \\nIn contrast to coarse-grained parallel implementations of GAS, fine-grained implementations \\ntypically assign one processor per individual in the population. Recombination then takes place among \\nneighboring individuals. Several different types of neighborhoods have been proposed, ranging from \\nplanar grid to torus. Examples of such systems are described by Spiessens and Manderick (1991). An \\nedited collection of papers on parallel GAS is available in Stender (1993).')]\n"

Introduction \\n \\n1.1 What Is Machine Learning?  \\nMachine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example \\ndata or past experience. We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the \\nexecution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or \\npast experience. The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or descriptive to gain \\nknowledge from data, or both. \\nArthur Samuel, an early American leader in the field of computer gaming and artificial intellige nce, \\ncoined the term “Machine Learning” in 1959 while at IBM. He defined machine learning as “the field of \\nstudy that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” However, there is \\nno universally accepted definition for machine learning. Different authors define the term differently. \\n \\nDefinition of learning \\nDefinition \\nA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and \\nperformance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. \\n \\nExamples \\ni) Handwriting recognition learning problem \\n• Task T: Recognising and classifying handwritten words within images \\n• Performance P: Percent of words correctly classified \\n• Training experience E: A dataset of handwritten words with given classifications \\nii) A robot driving learning problem \\n• Task T: Driving on highways using vision sensors \\n• Performance measure P: Average distance traveled before an error \\n• training experience: A sequence of images and steering commands recorded while  \\n  observing a human driver \\niii) A chess learning problem \\n• Task T: Playing chess \\n• Performance measure P: Percent of games won against opponents \\n• Training experience E: Playing practice games against itself \\nDefinition \\nA computer program which learns from experience is called a machine learning program or \\nsimply a learning program. Such a program is sometimes also referred to as a learner. \\n \\n1.2 Components of Learning \\n Basic components of learning process \\nThe learning process, whether by a human or a machine, can be divided into four components, \\nnamely, data storage, abstraction, generalization and evaluation. Figure 1.1 illustrates the \\nvariouscomponents and the steps involved in the learning process.'),\n",

Data storage \\nFacilities for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data are an important component of the \\nlearning process. Humans and computers alike utilize data storage as a foundation for advanced \\nreasoning. \\n• In a human being, the data is stored in the brain and data is retrieved using electrochemical    signals. \\n• Computers use hard disk drives, flash memory, random access memory and similar devices    to store \\ndata and use cables and other technology to retrieve data. \\n \\n2. Abstraction \\nThe second component of the learning process is known as abstraction. \\nAbstraction is the process of extracting knowledge about stored data. This involves creating general \\nconcepts about the data as a whole. The creation of knowledge involves application of known models \\nand creation of new models. \\nThe process of fitting a model to a dataset is known as training. When the model has been trained, the \\ndata is transformed into an abstract form that summarizes the original information. \\n \\n3. Generalization \\nThe third component of the learning process is known as generalisation. \\nThe term generalization describes the process of turning the knowledge about stored data into a form \\nthat can be utilized for future action. These actions are to be carried out o n tasks that are similar, but \\nnot identical, to those what have been seen before. In generalization, the goal is to discover those \\nproperties of the data that will be most relevant to future tasks. \\n \\n4. Evaluation \\nEvaluation is the last component of the learning process. \\nIt is the process of giving feedback to the user to measure the utility of the learned knowledge. This \\nfeedback is then utilised to effect improvements in the whole learning process \\n \\nApplications of machine learning \\nApplication of machine le arning methods to large databases is called data mining. In data \\nmining, a large volume of data is processed to construct a simple model with valuable use, for example, \\nhaving \\nhigh predictive accuracy. \\n \\nThe following is a list of some of the typical applications of machine learning. \\n1. In retail business, machine learning is used to study consumer behaviour. \\n2. In finance, banks analyze their past data to build models to use in credit applications, fraud \\ndetection, and the stock market. \\n3. In manufacturing, learning models are used for optimization, control, and troubleshooting.'),\n",

In medicine, learning programs are used for medical diagnosis. \\n5. In telecommunications, call patterns are analyzed for network optimization and maximizing the \\nquality of service. \\n6. In science, la rge amounts of data in physics, astronomy, and biology can only be analyzed fast \\nenough by computers.

In artificial intelligence, it is use d to teach a system to learn and adapt to changes so that the \\nsystem designer need not foresee and provide solutions for all possible situations.  \\n8. It is used to find solutions to many problems in vision, speech recognition, and robotics.  \\n9.

Machine learning methods have been used to develop programmes for playing games such as \\nchess, backgammon and Go. \\n \\n1.3 Learning Models \\nMachine learning is concerned with using the right features to build the right models that \\nachieve the right tasks.  The basic idea of Learning models has divided into three categories. \\nFor a given problem, the collection of all possible outcomes represent s the sample space or instance \\nspace. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Using a Logical expression. (Logical models) \\n\\uf0b7 Using the Geometry of the instance space. (Geometric models)  \\n\\uf0b7 Using Probability to classify the instance space. (Probabilistic models) \\n\\uf0b7 Grouping and Grading \\n \\n1.3.1  Logical models \\nLogical models use a logical expression to divide the instance space into segments and hence \\nconstruct grouping models. A  logical expression  is an expression that returns a Boolean value, i.e., a \\nTrue or False outcome. Once the data is grouped usin g a logical expression, the data is divided into \\nhomogeneous groupings for the problem we are trying to solve.   For example, for a classiﬁcation \\nproblem, all the instances in the group belong to one class. \\n \\nThere are mainly two kinds of logical models: Tree models and Rule models. \\n \\nRule models consist of a collection of implications or IF -THEN rules. For tree -based models, the ‘if-part’ \\ndeﬁnes a segment and the ‘then-part’ deﬁnes the behaviour of the model for this segment. Rule models \\nfollow the same reasoning. \\n \\nLogical models and Concept learning \\nTo understand logical models further, we need to understand the idea of  Concept Learning . \\nConcept Learning involves learning logical expressions or concepts from examples. The idea of Concept \\nLearning fits in well  with the idea of Machine learning, i.e., inferring a general function from specific \\ntraining examples. Concept learning forms the basis of both tree -based and rule -based models.  More \\nformally, Concept Learning involves acquiring the definition of a gener al category from a given set of \\npositive and negative training examples of the category. A Formal Definition for Concept Learning is \\n“The inferring of a Boolean -valued function from training examples of its input and output.”  In \\nconcept learning, we only l earn a description for the positive class and label everything that doesn’t \\nsatisfy that description as negative.'),\n",

Each data is described by six attributes. The task is to learn to predict the value of \\nEnjoy Sport for an arbitrary day based on the values of its attribute values. The problem can be \\nrepresented by a series of hypotheses. Each hypothesis is described by a conjunction of constraints on \\nthe attribu tes. The training data represents a set of positive and negative examples of the target \\nfunction. In the example above, each hypothesis is a vector of six constraints, specifying the values of \\nthe six attributes –  Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. The training phase involves \\nlearning the set of days (as a conjunction of attributes) for which Enjoy Sport = yes. \\n \\nThus, the problem can be formulated as: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Given instances X  which represent a set of all possible days, each described by the attributes: \\no Sky – (values: Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy), \\no AirTemp – (values: Warm, Cold), \\no Humidity – (values: Normal, High), \\no Wind – (values: Strong, Weak), \\no Water – (values: Warm, Cold), \\no Forecast – (values: Same, Change). \\n \\nTry to identify a function that can predict the target variable Enjoy Sport as yes/no, i.e., 1 or 0. \\n \\n1.3.2 Geometric models \\nIn the previous section, we have seen that with logical models, such as decision trees, a logical \\nexpression is used to partition the instance space. Two instances are similar when they end up in the \\nsame logical segment. In this section, we consider models that define similarity by considering the \\ngeometry of the instance space.   In Geometric models, features could be described as points in two \\ndimensions ( x- and y-axis) or a three-dimensional space ( x, y, and z). Even when features are not'),\n",

In geometric models, there are two ways we  could \\nimpose similarity. \\n\\uf0b7 We could use geometric concepts like  lines or planes to segment (classify)  the instance space. \\nThese are called Linear models. \\n\\uf0b7 Alternatively, we can use the geometric notion of distance to represent similarity. In this case, if \\ntwo points are close together, they have similar values for features and thus can be classed as \\nsimilar. We call such models as Distance-based models. \\n \\n \\nLinear models \\nLinear models are relatively simple. In this case, the function is represented as a linear \\ncombination of its inputs. Thus, if  x1 and x2 are two scalars or vectors of the same dimension \\nand a and b are arbitrary scalars, then  ax1 + bx2 represents a linear combination of  x1 and x2. In the \\nsimplest case where  f(x) represents a straight line, we ha ve an equation of the form  f (x) \\n= mx + c where c represents the intercept and m represents the slope. \\n \\n \\nLinear models are parametric, which means that they have a ﬁxed form with a small number of numeric \\nparameters that need to be learned from data. For example, in  f (x) =  mx + c, m and c are the \\nparameters that we are trying to learn from the data. This technique is different from tree or rule \\nmodels, where the structu re of the model (e.g., which features to use in the tree, and where) is  not \\nﬁxed in advance. \\n \\nLinear models are  stable, i.e., small variations in the t raining data have only a limited impact on the \\nlearned model. In contrast,  tree models tend to vary more with the training data , as the choice of a \\ndifferent split at the root of the tree typically means that the rest of the tree is different as well.   As a \\nresult of having relatively few parameters, Linear models have  low variance and high bias . This implies \\nthat Linear models are less likely to overfit  the training data  than some other models. However, they \\nare more likely to underfit. For example, if we want to learn the boundaries between countries based \\non labelled data, then linear models are not likely to give a good approximation. \\n \\nDistance-based models \\nDistance-based models are the second class of Geometric models. Like Linear models, distance-\\nbased models are based on the geometry of data. As the name implies, distance -based models work on \\nthe concept of distance.   In the context of Machine learning, the concept of distance is not based on \\nmerely the physical distance between two points. Instead, we  could think of the distance between two \\npoints considering the  mode of transport  between two points. Travelling between two cities by plane'),\n",

Similarly, in chess, the \\nconcept of distance depends on the piece used – for example, a Bishop can move diagonally.    Thus, \\ndepending on the entity and the mode of travel, the concept of distance can be experienced differently. \\nThe distance metrics commonly used are Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, and Mahalanobis. \\n \\n \\nDistance is applied through the concept of  neighbours and exemplars . Neighbours are points in \\nproximity with respect to the distance measure expressed through exemplars. Exemplars are \\neither centroids that ﬁnd a centre of mass according to a chosen distance metric or  medoids that ﬁnd \\nthe most centrally located data point. The most commonly used centroid is the arithmetic mean, which \\nminimises squared Euclidean distance to all other points. \\n \\nNotes: \\n\\uf0b7 The centroid represents the geometric centre of a plane figure, i.e., the arithmetic mean \\nposition of all the points in the figure from the centroid point. This definition extends to any \\nobject in n-dimensional space: its centroid is the mean position of all the points. \\n\\uf0b7 Medoids are similar in concept to means or centroids. Medoids are most commonly used on \\ndata when a mean or centroid cannot be defined. They are used in contexts where the centroid \\nis not representative of the dataset, such as in image data. \\n \\nExamples of distance-based models include the nearest-neighbour models, which use the training data \\nas exemplars – for example, in classification. The  K-means clustering algorithm also uses exemplars to \\ncreate clusters of similar data points. \\n \\n1.3.3 Probabilistic models \\nThe third family of machine learning algorithms is the probabilistic models. We have seen \\nbefore that the k -nearest neighbour algorithm uses the idea of distance (e.g., Euclidian distance) to \\nclassify entities, and logical models use a logical expressi on to partition the instance space. In this \\nsection, we see how the probabilistic models use the idea of probability to classify new entities. \\n \\nProbabilistic models see features and target variables as random variables. The process of modelling \\nrepresents and manipulates the level of uncertainty  with respect to these variables. There are two \\ntypes of probabilistic models:  Predictive and Generative. Predictive probability models use the idea of \\na conditional probability distribution P (Y |X) from which Y can be predicted from X.  Generative models \\nestimate the joint distribution P (Y, X).  Once we know the joint distribution for the generative models, \\nwe can derive any conditional or marginal distribution involving the same variables. Thus, the \\ngenerative model is capable of creating new data points and their labels, knowing the joint probability \\ndistribution. The joint distribution looks for a relationship between two variables. Once this relationship \\nis inferred, it is possible to infer new data points. \\nNaïve Bayes is an example of a probabilistic classifier. \\n \\nWe can do this using the Bayes rule defined as'),\n",

Training experience E: A set of games played against itself \\n \\n1.4.1 Type of training experience \\nDuring the design of the checker's learning system, the type of training experience available for a \\nlearning system will have a significant effect on the success or failure of the learning. \\n \\n1. Direct or Indirect training experience — In the case of direct training experience, an individual board \\nstates and correct move for each board state are given.  \\nIn case of indirect training experience, the move sequences for a game and the final result (win, loss \\nor draw) are given for a number of games. How to assign credit or blame to individual moves is the \\ncredit assignment problem. \\n2. Teacher or Not — Supervised — The training experience will be labeled, which means, all the board \\nstates will be labeled with the correct move. So the learning takes place in t he presence of a \\nsupervisor or a teacher.  \\nUnsupervised — The training experience will be unlabeled, which means, all the board states will not \\nhave the moves.

Is the training experience good — Do the training examples represent the distribution of examples \\nover whic h the final system performance will be measured? Performance is best when training \\nexamples and test examples are from the same/a similar distribution. \\n \\nThe checker player learns by playing against oneself. Its experience is indirect. It may not encounter \\nmoves that are common in human expert play. Once the proper training experience is available, the next \\ndesign step will be choosing the Target Function. \\n \\n1.4.2 Choosing the Target Function \\nWhen you are playing the checkers game, at any moment of time, you make a decision on \\nchoosing the best move from different possibilities. You think and apply the learning that you have \\ngained from the experience. Here the learning is, for a specific board, you move a checker such that your \\nboard state tends towards the w inning situation. Now the same learning has to be defined in terms of \\nthe target function. \\n \\nHere there are 2 considerations — direct and indirect experience. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 During the direct experience, the checkers learning system, it needs only to learn how to choose \\nthe best move among some large search space. We need to find a target function that will help \\nus choose the best move among alternatives. Let us call this function ChooseMove and use the \\nnotation ChooseMove : B →M to indicate that this function accepts as input any board from the \\nset of legal board states B and produces as output some move from the set of legal moves M. \\n\\uf0b7 When there is an indirect experience , it becomes difficult to learn su ch function. How about \\nassigning a real score to the board state.  \\n \\nSo the function be  V : B →R  indicating that this accepts as input any board from the set of legal board \\nstates B and produces an output a real score. This function assigns the higher score s to better board \\nstates. \\n \\n \\nIf the system can successfully learn such a target function V, then it can easily use it to select the best \\nmove from any board position.'),\n",

So this \\ndefinition is not efficiently computable by our checkers playing program, we say that it is a \\nnonoperational definition. \\n \\nThe goal of learning, in this case, is to discover an operational description of V ; that is, a description \\nthat can be used by the checkers-playing program to evaluate states and select moves within realistic \\ntime bounds. \\nIt may be very difficult in general to learn such an operational form of V perfectly. We expect learning \\nalgorithms to acquire only some approximation to the target function ^V. \\n \\n1.4.3 Choosing a representation for the Target Function \\nNow that we have specified the ideal target function V, we must choose a representation that \\nthe learning pr ogram will use to describe the function ^V that it will learn. As with earlier design \\nchoices, we again have many options. We could, for example, allow the program to represent using a \\nlarge table with a distinct entry specifying the value for each distinct board state. Or we could allow it to \\nrepresent using a collection of rules that match against features of the board state, or a quadratic \\npolynomial function of predefined board features, or an artificial \\nneural network. In general, this choice of repres entation involves a crucial tradeoff. On one hand, we \\nwish to pick a very expressive representation to allow representing as close an approximation as \\npossible to the ideal target function V.  \\n \\nOn the other hand, the more expressive the representation, the more training data the program \\nwill require in order to choose among the alternative hypotheses it can represent. To keep the \\ndiscussion brief, let us choose a simple representation:  \\nfor any given board state, the function ^V will be calculated as a linear combination of the following \\nboard features: \\n\\uf0b7 x1(b) — number of black pieces on board b \\n\\uf0b7 x2(b) — number of red pieces on b \\n\\uf0b7 x3(b) — number of black kings on b \\n\\uf0b7 x4(b) — number of red kings on b \\n\\uf0b7 x5(b) — number of red pieces threatened by black (i.e., which can be taken on black’s next turn) \\n\\uf0b7 x6(b) — number of black pieces threatened by red \\n \\n^V = w0 + w1 · x1(b) + w2 · x2(b) + w3 · x3(b) + w4 · x4(b) +w5 · x5(b) + w6 · x6(b) \\n \\nWhere w0 through w6 are numerical coefficients or weights to be obtained by a learning algorithm.  \\nWeights w1 to w6 will determine the relative importance of different board features.'),\n",

Each training example is an ordered pair <b,V_train(b)> \\nFor example, a training example may be <(x1 = 3, x2 = 0, x3 = 1, x4 = 0, x5 = 0, x6 = 0), +100\">. This is an \\nexample where black has won the game since x2 = 0 or red has no remaining pieces. However, such clean \\nvalues of V_train (b) can be obtained only for board value b that are clear win, loss or draw. \\nIn above case, assigning a training value V_train (b) for the specific boards b that are clean win, loss or \\ndraw is direct as they are direct training experience. But in the case of indirect training experience, \\nassigning a training value V_train(b) for the intermediate boards is difficult. In such case, the training \\nvalues are updated using temporal difference learning.  Temporal difference (TD) learning is a concept \\ncentral to reinforcement learning, in which learning happens through the iterative correction of your \\nestimated returns towards a more accurate target return. \\nLet Successor(b) denotes the next board state following b for which it is again the program’s turn to \\nmove. ^V is the learner’s current approximation to V. Using these information, assign the training value \\nof V_train(b) for any intermediate board state b as below :  \\nV_train(b) ← ^V(Successor(b)) \\n \\nAdjusting the weights \\nNow its time to define the learning algorithm for choosing the weights and best fit the set of \\ntraining examples. One common approach is to define the best hypothesis as that which minimizes the \\nsquared error E between the training values and the values predicted by the hypothesis ^V. \\n \\n \\nThe learning algorithm should incrementally refine weights as more training examples become available \\nand it needs to be robust to errors in training data Least Mean Square (LMS) training rule is the one \\ntraining algorithm that will adjust weights a small amount in the direction that reduces the error. \\n \\nThe LMS algorithm is defined as follows:'),\n",

We \\ncan use a s imilar method to train computers to do many tasks, such as playing backgammon or chess, \\nscheduling jobs, and controlling robot limbs. Reinforcement learning is different from supervised \\nlearning. Supervised learning is learning from examples provided by a knowledgeable expert. \\n \\n1.6 PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES IN MACHINE LEARNING \\n \\nPerspectives in Machine Learning \\nOne useful perspective on machine learning is that it involves searching a very large space of \\npossible hypotheses to determine one that best fits the observed data and any prior knowledge held by \\nthe learner. \\nFor example, consider the space of hypotheses that could in principle be output by the above checkers \\nlearner. This hypothesis space consists of all evaluation functions that can be represented by some \\nchoice of values for the weights wo through w6. The learner's task is thus to search through this vast \\nspace to locate the hypothesis that is most consistent with the available training examples. The LMS \\nalgorithm for fitting weights achieves this goa l by iteratively tuning the weights, adding a correction to \\neach weight each time the hypothesized evaluation function predicts a value that differs from the \\ntraining value. This algorithm works well when the hypothesis representation considered by the lea rner \\ndefines a continuously parameterized space of potential hypotheses.\"),\n",

For each of these hypothesis representations, the corresponding learning \\nalgorithm takes advantage of a different underlying structure to organize the search through the \\nhypothesis space.  \\n \\nThroughout this book we will return to this perspective of learning as a search problem in order \\nto characterize learning methods by their search strategies and by the underlying structure of the \\nsearch spaces they explore.

Can prior knowledge be helpful even when it is only approximately correct? \\n\\uf0b7 What is the best strategy for choosing a useful next training experience, and how does the \\nchoice of this strategy alter the complexity of the learning problem?  \\n\\uf0b7 What is the best way to reduce the learning task to one or more function approximation \\nproblems?

And the leaves, which are outcomes lik e either ‘fit’, or ‘unfit’. In this case this was a binary \\nclassification problem (a yes no type problem). There are two main types of Decision Trees: \\n1. Classification trees (Yes/No types) \\nWhat we have seen above is an example of classification tree, where t he outcome was a variable like \\n‘fit’ or ‘unfit’. Here the decision variable is Categorical. \\n \\n2. Regression trees (Continuous data types) \\nHere the decision or the outcome variable is Continuous, e.g. a number like 123.  Working Now that we \\nknow what a Decision  Tree is, we’ll see how it works internally. There are many algorithms out there \\nwhich construct Decision Trees, but one of the best is called as  ID3 Algorithm. ID3 Stands for  Iterative \\nDichotomiser 3. Before discussing the ID3 algorithm, we’ll go through few definitions. Entropy Entropy, \\nalso called as Shannon Entropy is denoted by H(S) for a finite set S, is the measure of the amount of \\nuncertainty or randomness in data. \\n \\nIntuitively, it tells us about the predictability of a certain event. Example, cons ider a coin toss whose \\nprobability of heads is 0.5 and probability of tails is 0.5. Here the entropy is the highest possible, since \\nthere’s no way of determining what the outcome might be. Alternatively, consider a coin which has \\nheads on both the sides, t he entropy of such an event can be predicted perfectly since we know \\nbeforehand that it’ll always be heads. In other words, this event has  no randomness hence it’s entropy \\nis zero. In particular, lower values imply less uncertainty while higher values impl y high \\nuncertainty. Information Gain Information gain is also called as Kullback -Leibler divergence denoted by \\nIG(S,A) for a set S is the effective change in entropy after deciding on a particular attribute A. It \\nmeasures the relative change in entropy with respect to the independent variables \\n \\n\\uf028 \\uf029 \\uf028 \\uf029 \\uf028 \\uf029ASHSHASIG ,, \\uf02d\\uf03d\\n \\nAlternatively, \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere IG(S, A) is the information gain by applying feature A.

Classification Trees \\nA classification tree is an algorithm where the target variable is fixed or categorical. The \\nalgorithm is then used to identify the “class” within which a target variable would most likely fall. \\nAn example of a classific ation-type problem would be determining who will or will not subscribe to a \\ndigital platform; or who will or will not graduate from high school. \\nThese are examples of simple binary classifications where the categorical dependent variable can \\nassume only on e of two, mutually exclusive values. In other cases, you might have to predict among a \\nnumber of different variables. For instance, you may have to predict which type of smartphone a \\nconsumer may decide to purchase. \\nIn such cases, there are multiple values  for the categorical dependent variable. Here’s what a classic \\nclassification tree looks like'),\n",

Regression Trees \\nA regression tree refers to an algorithm where the target variable is and the algorithm is used to \\npredict it’s value. As an example o f a regression type problem, you may want to predict the selling \\nprices of a residential house, which is a continuous dependent variable. \\nThis will depend on both continuous factors like square footage as well as categorical factors like the \\nstyle of home, area in which the property is located and so on. \\n \\n \\n \\nWhen to use Classification and Regression Trees \\nClassification trees are used when the dataset needs to be split into classes which belong to the \\nresponse variable. In many cases, the classes Yes or No. \\nIn other words, they are just two and mutually exclusive. In some cases, there may be more than two \\nclasses in which case a variant of the classification tree algorithm is used. \\nRegression trees, on the other hand, are used when the response variable is c ontinuous. For instance, if \\nthe response variable is something like the price of a property or the temperature of the day, a \\nregression tree is used. \\nIn other words, regression trees are used for prediction -type problems while classification trees are \\nused for classification-type problems. \\n \\nHow Classification and Regression Trees Work \\nA classification tree splits the dataset based on the homogeneity of data. Say, for instance, \\nthere are two variables; income and age; which determine whether or not a consume r will buy a \\nparticular kind of phone. \\nIf the training data shows that 95% of people who are older than 30 bought the phone, the data gets \\nsplit there and age becomes a top node in the tree. This split makes the data “95% pure”. Measures of \\nimpurity like entropy or Gini index are used to quantify the homogeneity of the data when it comes to \\nclassification trees.'),\n",

After this, the data is split at several points for each independent variable. \\nAt each such point, the error between the predicted values and actual values is squared to get “A Sum \\nof Squared Errors” (SSE). The SSE is compared across the variables and the variable or point which has \\nthe lowest SSE is chosen as the split point. This process is continued recursively. \\n \\n \\nAdvantages of Classification and Regression Trees \\nThe purpose of the analysis conducted by any classification or regression tree is to create a set of if -else \\nconditions that allow for the accurate prediction or classification of a case. \\n(i) The Results are Simplistic \\nThe interpretation of results summarized in classification or regression trees is usually fairly simple. The \\nsimplicity of results helps in the following ways. \\n\\uf0b7 It allows for the rapid classification of new observations. That’s because it is much simpler to \\nevaluate just one or two logical conditions than to compute scores using complex nonlinear \\nequations for each group. \\n\\uf0b7 It can often result in a simpler model which  explains why the observations are either classified \\nor predicted in a certain way. For instance, business problems are much easier to explain with \\nif-then statements than with complex nonlinear equations. \\n(ii) Classification and Regression Trees are Nonparametric & Nonlinear \\nThe results from classification and regression trees can be summarized in simplistic if -then conditions. \\nThis negates the need for the following implicit assumptions. \\n\\uf0b7 The predictor variables and the dependent variable are linear. \\n\\uf0b7 The predictor variables and the dependent variable follow some specific nonlinear link function. \\n\\uf0b7 The predictor variables and the dependent variable are monotonic. \\nSince there is no need for such implicit assumptions, classification and regression tree methods a re well \\nsuited to data mining. This is because there is very little knowledge or assumptions that can be made \\nbeforehand about how the different variables are related. \\nAs a result, classification and regression trees can actually reveal relationships betwe en these variables \\nthat would not have been possible using other techniques. \\n(iii) Classification and Regression Trees Implicitly Perform Feature Selection \\nFeature selection or variable screening is an important part of analytics. When we use decision tree s, \\nthe top few nodes on which the tree is split are the most important variables within the set. As a result, \\nfeature selection gets performed automatically and we don’t need to do it again. \\nLimitations of Classification and Regression Trees'),\n",

This is a testament to the popularity of these decision trees and how frequently they are \\nused. However, these decision trees are not without their disadvantages. \\nThere are many classification and regression trees examples where the use of a decision tree has not \\nled to the optimal result. Here are some of the limitations of classification and regression trees. \\n(i) Overfitting \\nOverfitting occurs when the tree takes into account a lot of noise that exists in the data and \\ncomes up with an inaccurate result. \\n(ii) High variance \\nIn this case, a small variance in the data can lead to a very high variance in the prediction, \\nthereby affecting the stability of the outcome. \\n(iii) Low bias \\nA decision tree that is very complex usually has a low bias. This makes it very difficult for the \\nmodel to incorporate any new data. \\n \\nWhat is a CART in Machine Learning? \\nA Classification and Regression Tree (CART) is a predictive algorithm used in  machine learning. It \\nexplains how a target variable’s values can be predicted based on other values. \\nIt is a decision tree where each fork is a split in a predictor variable and each node at the end has a \\nprediction for the target variable. \\nThe CART algorithm is an important  decision tree algorithm  that lies at the foundation of machine \\nlearning. Moreover, it is also the basis for other powerful machine learning algorithms like bagged \\ndecision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees. \\nSumming up \\nThe Classification and regression tree (CART) methodology is one of the oldest and most fundamental \\nalgorithms. It is used to predict outcomes based on certain predictor variables. \\nThey are excellent for data mining tasks because they require  very little data pre -processing. Decision \\ntree models are easy to understand and implement which gives them a strong advantage when \\ncompared to other analytical models. \\n \\n2.2. Regression \\nRegression Analysis in Machine learning \\nRegression analysis is a stat istical method to model the relationship between a dependent \\n(target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables. More \\nspecifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is \\nchanging corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It \\npredicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc. \\n \\nWe can understand the concept of regression analysis using the below example: \\n \\nExample: Suppose there is a marketing company A, who does various advertisement every year and get \\nsales on that. The below list shows the advertisement made by the company in the last 5 years and the \\ncorresponding sales:'),\n",

So to solve such type of prediction problems in machine \\nlearning, we need regression analysis. \\nRegression is a  supervised learning technique  which helps in finding the correlation between variables \\nand enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on the one or more predictor variables. \\nIt is mainly used for  prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal -effect \\nrelationship between variables. \\nIn Regression, we plot a graph between the variables which best fits the given datapoints, using this \\nplot, the machine learning model can make predictions about the data. In simple words,  \"Regression \\nshows a line or curve tha t passes through all the datapoints on target -predictor graph in such a way \\nthat the vertical distance between the datapoints and the regression line is minimum.\"  The distance \\nbetween datapoints and line tells whether a model has captured a strong relationship or not. \\n \\nSome examples of regression can be as: \\no Prediction of rain using temperature and other factors \\no Determining Market trends \\no Prediction of road accidents due to rash driving. \\n \\nTerminologies Related to the Regression Analysis: \\no Dependent Variable:  The main factor in Regression analysis which we want to predict or \\nunderstand is called the dependent variable. It is also called target variable. \\no Independent Variable: The factors which affect the dependent variables or which are used to \\npredict the valu es of the dependent variables are called independent variable, also called as \\na predictor. \\no Outliers: Outlier is an observation which contains either very low value or very high value in \\ncomparison to other observed values. An outlier may hamper the result,  so it should be \\navoided. \\no Multicollinearity: If the independent variables are highly correlated with each other than other \\nvariables, then such condition is called Multicollinearity. It should not be present in the dataset, \\nbecause it creates problem while ranking the most affecting variable. \\no Underfitting and Overfitting: If our algorithm works well with the training dataset but not well \\nwith test dataset, then such problem is called  Overfitting. And if our algorithm does not \\nperform well even with training dataset, then such problem is called underfitting.'),\n",

Of course, some sets of positive and negative examples cannot be \\nseparated by any hyperplane. Those that can be separated are called linearly separable sets of \\nexamples.  \\n \\n \\nThe decision surface represented by a two-input perceptron. (a) A set of training examples and \\nthe decision surface of a perceptron that classifies them correctly. (b) A set of training examples that is \\nnot linearly separable (i.e., that cannot be correctly classified by any s traight line). xl and x2 are the \\nPerceptron inputs. Positive examples are indicated by \"+\", negative by \"-\". The inputs are fed to multiple \\nunits, and the outputs of these units are then input to a second, final stage. One way is to represent the \\nBoolean function in disjunctive normal form (i.e., as the disjunction (OR) of a set of conjunctions (ANDs) \\nof the inputs and their negations). Note that the input to an AND perceptron can be negated simply by \\nchanging the sign of the corresponding input weight. Because networks of threshold units can represent \\na rich variety of functions and because single units alone cannot, we will generally be interested in \\nlearning multilayer networks of threshold units. \\n \\nThe Perceptron Training Rule \\nAlthough we are interested i n learning networks of many interconnected units, let us begin by \\nunderstanding how to learn the weights for a single perceptron. Here the precise learning problem is to \\ndetermine a weight vector that causes the perceptron to produce the correct \\n1\\uf0b1  output for each of the \\ngiven training examples. \\nSeveral algorithms are known to solve this learning problem. Here we consider two: the \\nperceptron rule and the delta rule. These two algorithms are guaranteed to converge to somewhat \\ndifferent acceptable hypotheses, under somewhat different conditions. They are important to ANNs \\nbecause they provide the basis for learning networks of many units. \\nOne way to learn an acceptable weight vector is to begin with random weights, then iteratively \\napply the perceptron to each training example, modifying the perceptron weights whenever it \\nmisclassifies an example. This process is repeated, iterating through the training examples as many \\ntimes as needed until \\nthe perceptron classifies all training examples correctly. Weights are modified at each step according to \\nthe perceptron training rule, which revises the weight wi associated with input xi according to the rule \\n \\n \\nHere t is the target output for the current training example, o is the output generated by the'),\n",

The role of the learning rate is to \\nmoderate the degree to which weights are changed at each step. It is usually set to some small value \\n(e.g., 0.1) and is sometimes made to decay as the number of weight-tuning iterations increases. \\nWhy should this update rule converge toward successful weight values? To get an intuitive feel, \\nconsider some specific cases. Suppose the training example is cor rectly classified already by the \\nperceptron. In this case, (t - o) is zero, making \\nwi\\uf044  zero, so that no weights are updated. Suppose the \\nperceptron outputs a -1, when the target output is +1. To make the perceptron output a+1 instead of -1 \\nin this case, the weights must be altered to increase the value of \\n\\uf0ae\\uf0ae\\nxw.  For example, if xi>0, then \\nincreasing wi will bring the perceptron closer to correctly classifying this example. Notice the training \\nrule will increase w, in this case, because (t - o),\\n\\uf068 , and xi are all positive. For example, if xi = .8, \\n\\uf068  = 0.1, \\nt = 1, and o = - 1, then the weight update will be \\nwi\\uf044  = \\n\\uf068  (t - o)xi = O.1(1 - (-1))0.8 = 0.16. On the \\nother hand, if t = -1 and o = 1, then weights associated with positive xi will be decreased rather than \\nincreased. \\n \\nIn fact, the above learning procedure can be proven to converge within a finite number of applications \\nof the perceptron training rule to a weight vector that correctly classifies all training examples, provided \\nthe training examples are linearly separable and provided a sufficiently small \\n\\uf068  is used. If the data are \\nnot linearly separable, convergence is not assured. \\n \\nGradient Descent and the Delta Rule \\nAlthough the perceptron rule finds a successful weight vector when the training examples are \\nlinearly separable, it can fail to converge if the examples are not linearly separable. A second training \\nrule, called the delta rule, is designed to overcome this difficulty. If the training examples are not \\nlinearly separable, the delta rule converges toward a best -fit approximation to the target concept. The \\nkey idea behind the delta rule is  to use gradient descent to search the hypothesis space of possible \\nweight vectors to find the weights that best fit the training examples. This rule is important because \\ngradient descent provides the basis for the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm, which can lear n networks \\nwith many interconnected units. It is also important because gradient descent can serve as the basis for \\nlearning algorithms that must search through hypothesis spaces containing many different types of \\ncontinuously parameterized hypotheses.  \\nThe delta training rule is best understood by considering the task of training an unthresholded \\nperceptron; that is, a linear unit for which the output o is given by \\n \\n \\n \\nThus, a linear unit corresponds to the first stage of a perceptron, without the threshold. \\nIn order to derive a weight learning rule for linear units, let us begin by specifying a measure for the \\ntraining error of a hypothesis (weight vector), relative to the training examples. Although there are \\nmany ways to define this error, one common measure that will turn out to be especially convenient is \\n \\nwhere D is the set of training examples, td is the target output for training example d, and od is the \\noutput of the linear unit for training example d.

Given a set of features  X=x1,x2,...,xm and a target y, it can learn a non-\\nlinear function approximator for either classification or regression.

Sum rule is the most intuitive and is the most widely used in practice. Median rule is \\nmore robust to outliers; minimum and maximum rules are pessimistic and optimistic, respectively. With \\nthe product rule, each learner has veto power; regardless o f the other ones, if one learner has an \\noutput of 0, the overall output goes to 0. Note that after the combination rules, yi do not necessarily \\nsum up to 1. \\n \\nTable 2: Example of combination rules on three learners and three classes \\n \\nIn weighted sum, dji is the vote of learner j for class Ci and wj is the weight of its vote. Simple voting is a \\nspecial case where all voters have equal weight, namely, wj = 1/L. In classification, this is called plurality \\nvoting where the class having the maximum number of votes is the winner. \\n \\nWhen there are two classes, this is majority voting where the winning class gets more than half of the \\nvotes. If the voters can also supply the additional information of how much they vote for each class \\n(e.g., by the posterior probability), then after normalization, these can be used as weights in a weighted \\nvoting scheme. Equivalently, if dji are the class posterior probabilities, P(Ci | x,Mj ), then we can just sum \\nthem up (wj = 1/L) and choose the class with maximum yi . \\n \\nIn the case  of regression, simple or weighted averaging or median can be used to fuse the outputs of \\nbase-regressors. Median is more robust to noise than the average. \\n \\nAnother possible way to find wj is to assess the accuracies of the learners (regressor or classifie r) on a \\nseparate validation set and use that information to compute the weights, so that we give more weights \\nto more accurate learners. \\n \\nVoting schemes can be seen as approximations under a Bayesian framework with weights \\napproximating prior model probabi lities, and model decisions approximating model -conditional \\nlikelihoods.  \\n \\n \\n \\nSimple voting corresponds to a uniform prior. If we have a prior distribution preferring simpler models, \\nthis would give larger weights to them.

We can thus view \\nusing different algor ithms and input features as efforts to decrease, if not completely eliminate, the \\npositive correlation. \\n \\n3.3 Error-Correcting Output Codes \\nThe Error-Correcting Output Codes method is a technique that allows a multi-class classification \\nproblem to be reframed as multiple binary classification problems, allowing the use of native binary \\nclassification models to be used directly. \\n \\nUnlike one-vs-rest and one-vs-one methods that offer a similar solution by dividing a multi-class \\nclassification problem into a fixed number of binary classification problems, the error -correcting output \\ncodes technique allows each class to be encoded as an arbitrary numbe r of binary classification \\nproblems. When an overdetermined representation is used, it allows the extra models to act as “error -\\ncorrection” predictions that can result in better predictive performance. \\n \\nIn error-correcting output codes (ECOC), the main cla ssification task is defined in terms of a \\nnumber of subtasks that are implemented by the base -learners. The idea is that the original task of \\nseparating one class from all other classes may be a difficult problem. Instead, we want to define a set \\nof simple r classification problems, each specializing in one aspect of the task, and combining these \\nsimpler classifiers, we get the final classifier. \\n \\nBase-learners are binary classifiers having output −1/ + 1, and there is a code matrix W of K × L whose K \\nrows are the binary codes of classes in terms of the L base-learners dj. For example, if the second row of \\nW is [−1,+1,+1,−1], this means that for us to say an instance belongs to C2, the instance should be on the \\nnegative side of d1 and d4, and on the pos itive side of d2 and d3. Similarly, the columns of the code \\nmatrix defines the task of the base -learners. For example, if the third column is [−1,+1,+1]T , we \\nunderstand that the task of the third base -learner, d3, is to separate the instances of C1 from t he \\ninstances of C2 and C3 combined. This is how we form the training set of the base -learners. For example \\nin this case, all instances labeled with C2 and C3 form X+\\n3  and instances labeled with C1 form X−\\n3 , and d3 is \\ntrained so that xt ∈ X+\\n3  give output +1 and xt ∈ X−\\n3  give output −1. \\n \\nThe code matrix thus allows us to define a polychotomy ( K > 2 classification problem) in terms of \\ndichotomies ( K = 2 classification problem), and it is a method that is applicable using any learning'),\n",

For \\nexample, for K = 4, \\n \\n \\nwe have \\n                     \\nThe problem here is that if there is an error with one of the baselea rners, there may be a \\nmisclassification because the class code words are so similar. So the approach in error -correcting codes \\nis to have L > K and increase the Hamming distance between the code words. One possibility is pairwise \\nseparation of classes where there is a separate baselearner to separate Ci from Cj, for i < j. In this case, L \\n= K(K − 1)/2 and with K = 4, the code matrix is \\n \\n \\nwhere a 0 entry denotes “don’t care.” That is, d1 is trained to separate C 1 from C2 and does not use the \\ntraining instances belonging to the other classes. Similarly, we say that an instance belongs to C 2 if d1 = \\n−1 and d4 = d5 = +1, and we do not consider the values of d2, d3, and d6.

With K classes, there are 2 (K-1) − 1 \\npossible columns, namely, two-class problems.

In order to promote model variance, bagging trains each model in the \\nensemble using a randomly drawn subset of the training set. As an e xample, the  random \\nforest algorithm combines random decision trees with bagging to achieve very high classification \\naccuracy. \\nThe simplest method of combining classifiers is known  as bagging, which stands for bootstrap \\naggregating, the statistical description of the method. This is fine if you know what a bootstrap is, but \\nfairly useless if you don’t. A bootstrap sample is a sample taken from the original dataset with \\nreplacement, so that we may get some data several times and others not at all. The bootstrap sample is \\nthe same size as the original, and lots and lots of these samples are taken: B of them, where B is at least \\n50, and could even be in the thousands. The name bootstrap  is more popular in computer science than \\nanywhere else, since there is also a bootstrap loader, which is the first program to run when a computer \\nis turned on. It comes from the nonsensical idea of ‘picking yourself up by your bootstraps,’ which \\nmeans lifting yourself up by your shoelaces, and is meant to imply starting from nothing. \\nBootstrap sampling seems like a very strange thing to do. We’ve taken a perfectly good dataset, \\nmucked it up by sampling from it, which might be good if we had made a smaller dataset (since it would \\nbe faster), but we still ended up with a dataset the same size. Worse, we’ve done it lots of times. Surely \\nthis is just a way to burn up computer time without gaining anything. The benefit of it is that we will get \\nlots of learners that perform slightly differently, which is exactly what we want for an ensemble \\nmethod. Another benefit is that estimates of the accuracy of the classification function can be made \\nwithout complicated analytic work, by throwing computer resources at the p roblem (technically, \\nbagging is a variance reducing algorithm; the meaning of this will become clearer when we talk about \\nbias and variance).

The most interesting thing about a random forest is the \\nways that it creates randomness from a standard  dataset. The first of the methods that it uses is the \\none that we have just seen: bagging. If we wish to create a forest then we can make the trees different \\nby training them on slightly different data, so we take bootstrap samples from the dataset for each tree. \\nHowever, this isn’t enough randomness yet. The other obvious place where it is possible to add \\nrandomness is to limit the choices that the decision tree can make. At each node, a random subset of \\nthe features is given to the tree, and it can only pick from that subset rather than from the whole set. \\nAs well as increasing the randomness in the training of each tree, it also speeds up the training, \\nsince there are fewer features to search over at each stage. Of course, it does introduce a new \\nparameter (how many features to consider), but the random forest does not seem to be very sensitive \\nto this parameter; in practice, a subset size that is the square root of the number of features seems to \\nbe common. The effect of these two forms of randomness is to reduce the variance without effecting \\nthe bias. Another benefit of this is that there is no need to prune the trees. There is another parameter \\nthat we don’t know how to choose yet, which is the number of trees to put into the forest. However, \\nthis is fairly easy to pick if we want optimal results: we can keep on building trees until the error stops \\ndecreasing.  \\nOnce the set of trees are trained, the output of the forest is the majority vote for classification, \\nas with the other committee methods that we  have seen, or the mean response for regression. And \\nthose are pretty much the main features needed for creating a random forest. The algorithm is given \\nnext before we see some results of using the random forest. \\n \\nAlgorithm \\nHere is an outline of the random forest algorithm. \\n1. The random forests algorithm generates many classification trees. Each tree is generated as \\nfollows: \\na) If the number of examples in the training set is N, take a sample of N examples at \\nrandom - but with replacement, from the original data . This sample will be the training \\nset for generating the tree. \\nb) If there are M input variables, a number m is specified such that at each node, m \\nvariables are selected at random out of the M and the best split on these m is used to'),\n",

The val ue of m is held constant during the generation of the various \\ntrees in the forest. \\nc) Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. \\n2. To classify a new object from an input vector, put the input vector down each of the trees in the \\nforest. Each tree gives a classification, and we say the tree “votes” for that class. The forest \\nchooses the classification \\n \\nThe implementation of this is very easy: we modify the decision to take an extra parameter, which is m, \\nthe number of features that should be used in the selection set at each stage. We will look at an \\nexample of using it shortly as a comparison to boosting. \\n \\nLooking at the algorithm you might be able to see that it is a very unusual machine learning \\nmethod because it is embarrassingly parallel: since the t rees do not depend upon each other, you can \\nboth create and get decisions from different trees on different individual processors if you have them. \\nThis means that the random forest can run on as many processors as you have available with nearly \\nlinear speedup. \\n \\nThere is one more nice thing to mention about random forests, which is that with a little bit of \\nprogramming effort they come with built -in test data: the bootstrap sample will miss out about 35% of \\nthe data on average, the so-called out-of-bootstrap examples. If we keep track of these datapoints then \\nthey can be used as novel samples for that particular tree, giving an estimated test error that we get \\nwithout having to use any extra datapoints. \\n \\nThis avoids the need for cross-validation. \\n \\nAs a brief  example of using the random forest, we start by demonstrating that the random \\nforest gets the correct results on the Party example that has been used in both this and the previous \\nchapters, based on 10 trees, each trained on 7 samples, and with just two levels allowed in each tree: \\n \\n \\n \\nAs a rather more involved example, the car evaluation dataset in the UCI Repository contains 1,728 \\nexamples aiming to classify whether or not a car is a good purchase based on six attributes. The \\nfollowing results compare a single decision tree, bagging, and a random forest with 50 trees, each based \\non 100 samples, and with a maximum depth of five for each tree.

In boosting, we actively try to generate complementary base -learners by training the \\nnext learner on the mistakes of the previous learners. The original boosting algorithm combines three \\nweak learners to generate a strong learner. A weak learner has error probability less than 1/2, which \\nmakes it better than random guessing on a two -class problem, and a strong learner has arbitrarily small \\nerror probability. \\n \\nOriginal Boosting Concept \\nGiven a large trai ning set, we randomly divide it into three. We use X1 and train d1. We then take X2 \\nand feed it to d1. We take all instances misclassified by d1 and also as many instances on which d1 is \\ncorrect \\nfrom X2, and these together form the training set of d2. We then take X3 and feed it to d1 and d2. The \\ninstances on which d1 and d2 disagree form the training set of d3. During testing, given an instance, we \\ngive it to d1 and d2; if they agree, that is the response, otherwise the response of d3 is taken as the \\noutput. \\n \\n1. Split data X into {X1, X2, X3} \\n2. Train d1 on X1 \\n\\uf0a7 Test d1 on X2 \\n3. Train d2 on d1’s mistakes on X2 (plus some right) \\n\\uf0a7 Test d1 and d2 on X3 \\n4. Train d3 on disagreements between d1 and d2 \\n\\uf0a7 Testing: apply d1 and d2; if disagree, use d3 \\n\\uf0a7 Drawback: need large X \\n \\noverall system has reduced error rate, and the error rate can arbitrarily be reduced by using such \\nsystems recursively, that is, a boosting system of three models used as dj in a higher system. \\n \\nThough it is quite successful, the disadvantage of the origin al boosting method is that it requires a very \\nlarge training sample. The sample should be divided into three and furthermore, the second and third \\nclassifiers are only trained on a subset on which the previous ones err. So unless one has a quite large \\ntraining set, d2 and d3 will not have training \\nsets of reasonable size. \\n \\n3.5.1AdaBoost \\n         Freund and Schapire (1996) proposed a variant, named AdaBoost, short for adaptive boosting, \\nthat uses the same training set over and over and thus need not be large , but the classifiers should be \\nsimple so that they do not overfit. AdaBoost can also combine an arbitrary number of baselearners, not \\nthree. \\n \\nAdaBoost algorithm'),\n",

Let us say pt\\nj \\ndenotes the probability that the instance pair (xt, rt) is drawn to train the jth base-learner. \\nInitially, all pt\\n1 = 1/N. Then we add new base -learners as follows, starting from j = 1:  Є j denotes the \\nerror rate of dj .  \\nAdaBoost requires that learners are weak, that is,  Є j < 1/2,∀j;  if  not, we stop adding new base -\\nlearners. Note that this error rate is not on the original problem but on the dataset used at step j. We \\ndefine  βj = Є j /(1 −Є j) < 1, and we set pt\\nj+1 = βj pt\\nj if dj correctly classifies xt ; otherwise, pt\\nj +1 = pt\\nj.   \\nBecause pt\\nj+1  should be probabilities, there is a normalization where we divide pt\\nj+1 by  𝑡 pt\\nj+1 , so that \\nthey sum up to 1. This has the effect that the probability of a correctly classified ins tance is decreased, \\nand the probability of a misclassified instance increases. Then a new sample of the same size is drawn \\nfrom the original sample according to these modified probabilities, pt\\nj+1 with replacement, and is used to \\ntrain dj+1. \\n  \\nThis has the effect that dj+1 focuses more on instances misclassified by dj ; that is why the base -learners \\nare chosen to be simple and not accurate, since otherwise the next training sample would contain only \\na few outlier and noisy instances repeated many times over. For example, with decision trees, decision \\nstumps, which are trees grown only one or two levels, are used. So it is clear that these would have bias \\nbut the decrease in variance is larger and the overall error decreases. An algorithm like the linear \\ndiscriminant has low variance, and we cannot gain by AdaBoosting linear discriminants. \\n. \\n3.5.2 Stacking - Stacked Generalization \\nStacked generalization is a technique proposed by Wolpert (1992) that extends voting in that \\nthe way the output of the base -learners is combined need not be linear but is learned through a \\ncombiner system, f ( ·|Φ), which is another learner, whose parameters Φ are also trained. (see the \\nbelow given figure)'),\n",

We cannot train the combiner function on the training data because the base -learners \\nmay be memorizing the training set; the combiner system should act ually learn how the baselearners \\nmake errors. Stacking is a means of estimating and correcting for the biases of the base -learners. \\nTherefore, the combiner should be trained on data unused in training the base-learners. \\n \\nIf f (·|w1, . . . , wL) is a linear model with constraints, wi ≥ 0,  𝑗Wj = 1, the optimal weights can be found \\nby constrained regression, but of course we do not need to enforce this; in stacking, there is no \\nrestriction on the combiner function and unlike voting, f (·) can be nonlinear. Fo r example, it may be \\nimplemented as a multilayer perceptron with Φ its connection weights. \\n \\nThe outputs of the base -learners dj define a new L-dimensional space in which the output \\ndiscriminant/regression function is learned by the combiner function. \\n \\nIn stacked generalization, we would like the base-learners to be as different as possible so that they will \\ncomplement each other, and, for this, it is best if they are based on different learning algorithms. If we \\nare combining classifiers that can generate continuous outputs, for example, posterior probabilities, it is \\nbetter that they be the combined rather than hard decisions. \\nWhen we compare a trained combiner as we have in stacking, with a fixed rule such as in \\nvoting, we see that both have their advanta ges: A trained rule is more flexible and may have less bias, \\nbut adds extra parameters, risks introducing variance, and needs extra time and data for training. Note \\nalso that there is no need to normalize classifier outputs before stacking. \\n \\n3.6 Probabilistic Learning \\nIn machine learning , a  probabilistic classifier  is a  classifier that is able to predict, given an \\nobservation of an input, a  probability distribution over a set of classes, rather than only outputting the \\nmost likely class that the observation should belong to. Probabilistic classifiers provide classification \\nthat can be useful in its own right or when combining classifiers into ensembles. \\n \\nOne criticism that is often made of neural networks —especially the MLP—is that it is not clear exactly \\nwhat it is doing: while we can go and have a look at the activations of the neurons and the weights, they \\ndon’t tell us much.'),\n",

This requires \\nunsupervised learning,  Suppose that the different classes each come from their own Gaussian \\ndistribution. This is known as multi-modal data, since there is one distribution (mode) for each different \\nclass. We can’t fit one Gaussian to the data, because it doesn’t look Gaussian overall. \\n \\nThere is, however, something we can do. If we know how many classes there are in the data, \\nthen we can try to estimate the parameters for that many Gaussians, all at once. If we don’t know, then \\nwe can try different numbers and see which one works  best. We will talk about this issue more for a \\ndifferent method (the k-means algorithm) in Unit 2. It is perfectly possible to use any other probability \\ndistribution instead of a Gaussian, but Gaussians are by far the most common choice. Then the output \\nfor any particular datapoint that is input to the algorithm will be the sum of the values expected by all \\nof the M Gaussians: \\n \\n \\nwhere _(x ; μm,  𝑚) is a Gaussian function with mean μm and covariance matrix  𝑚, and the  αm are \\nweights with the constraint that  𝛼𝑚 𝑀\\n𝑚=1  =1. \\n \\nThe given figures 4 shows two examples, where the data (shown by the histograms) comes from two \\ndifferent Gaussians, and the model is computed as a sum or mixture of the two Gaussians together.  \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 4: Histograms of training data from a mixture of two Gaussians and two fitted models, shown as \\nthe line plot. The model shown on the left fits well, but the one on the right produces two Gaussians \\nright on top of each other that do not fit the data well. \\n \\n \\nThe figure also gives you some idea of how to use the mixture model once it has been created.

In fact, it is \\ncommon to compute the log likelihood and then to maximise that; it is guaranteed to be negative, since \\nprobabilities are all less than 1, and the logarithm spreads out the values, making the optimisation more \\neffective. The algorithm that is used is an example of a very general one known as the expectation -\\nmaximisation (or more compactly, EM) algorithm. \\n \\n3.8 The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) Algorithm \\nThe basic idea of the EM algorithm is that sometimes it is easie r to add extra variables that are \\nnot actually known (called hidden or latent variables) and then to maximise the function over those \\nvariables. This might seem to be making a problem much more complicated than it needs to be, but it \\nturns out for many problems that it makes finding the solution significantly easier. \\nIn order to see how it works, we will consider the simplest interesting case of the Gaussian \\nmixture model: a combination of just two Gaussian mixtures. The assumption now is that sample from \\nthat Gaussian. If the probability of picking Gaussian one is p, then the entire model looks like this \\n(where N(μ, σ2) specifies a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ): \\n \\n \\n \\nIf the probability distribution of p is written as π, then the probability density is: \\n \\n \\n \\nFinding the maximum likelihood solution (actually the maximum log likelihood) to this problem \\nis then a case of computing the sum of the logarithm of Equation  over all of the training data, and \\ndifferentiating it, which would be rather difficult. Fortunately, there is a way around it. The key insight \\nthat we need is that if we knew which of the two Gaussian components the datapoint came from, then \\nthe computation would be easy. The mean and standard deviation for each component  could be \\ncomputed from the datapoints that belong to that component, and there would not be a problem. \\nAlthough we don’t know which component each datapoint came from, we can pretend we do, by \\nintroducing a new variable f. If f = 0 then the data came from Gaussian one, if f = 1 then it came from \\nGaussian two. \\n \\nThis is the typical initial step of an EM algorithm: adding latent variables. Now we just need to \\nwork out how to optimise over them. This is the time when the reason for the algorithm being called \\nexpectation-maximisation becomes clear.We don’t know much about variable f (hardly surprising, since \\nwe invented it), but we can compute its expectation (that is, the value that we ‘expect’ to see, which is \\nthe mean average) from the data: \\n \\n \\n \\nwhere D denotes the data.

Note that the \\nestimate never gets any s maller, and it turns out that EM algorithms are guaranteed to reach a local \\nmaxima. To see how this looks for the two -component Gaussian mixture, we’ll take a closer look at the \\nalgorithm: \\n \\n \\nThe trick with applying EM algorithms to problems is in identify ing the correct latent variables \\nto include, and then simply working through the steps.

We are now going to turn our attention to something much \\nsimpler, which is how we ca n use information about nearby datapoints to decide on classification \\noutput. For this we don’t use a model of the data at all, but directly use the data that is available. \\n \\n3.9 Information Criteria \\nwe introduced the idea of a validation set, or using cross -validation if there was not enough \\ndata. However, this replaces data with computation time, as many models are trained on different \\ndatasets. \\n \\nAn alternative idea is to identify some measure that tel ls us about how well we can expect this \\ntrained model to perform. Probabilistic model selection (or “ information criteria ”) provides an \\nanalytical technique for scoring and choosing among candidate models. Models are scored both on \\ntheir performance on the  training dataset and based on the complexity of the model.There are two \\nsuch information criteria that are commonly used: \\n \\n \\n \\nIn these equations, k is the number of parameters in the model, N is the number of training \\nexamples, and L is the best (largest)  likelihood of the model.

The first thing you could do would be just to pick the \\nperson closest to you and copy them. However, since most of the people who are in the nightclub are \\nalso unlikely to know all the moves, you might decide to look at a few more people and do what most of \\nthem are doing. This is pretty much exactly the idea behind nearest neighbour methods: if we don’t \\nhave a model that describes the data, then the best thing to do is to look at similar data and choose to \\nbe in the same class as them. \\n \\nWe have the datapoints positioned within input space, so we just need to work out which of the \\ntraining data are close to it. This requires computing the distance to each datapoint in the training set, \\nwhich is relatively expensive: if we are in normal Euclidean space, then we have to compute d \\nsubtractions and d squarings (we can ignore the square root since we only want to know which points \\nare the closest, not the actual distance) and this has to be done O( N2) times. We can then identify the k \\nnearest neighbours to the test point, and then set the class of the test point to be the most common \\none out of those for the nearest neighbours. The choice of k is not trivial. Make it too small and nearest \\nneighbour methods are sensitive to noise, too large and the accura cy reduces as points that are too far \\naway are considered.

Fortunately, as with many problems in computer science, designing an \\nefficient data structure can reduce the computational overhead a lot. For the problem of finding \\nnearest neighbours the data structure of choice is the KD -Tree. It has been around since the late 1970s, \\nwhen it was devised by Friedman and Bentley, and it reduces the cost of finding a nearest neighbour to \\nO(log N) for O(N) storage. The construction of the tree is O( N log2 N), with much of the computational \\ncost being in the computation of the median, which with a naïve algorithm requires a sort and is \\ntherefore O(N log N), or can be computed with a randomised algorithm in O(N) time. \\n \\nThe idea behind the KD-tree is very simple. You create a binary tree by choosing one dimensio n \\nat a time to split into two, and placing the line through the median of the point coordinates of that \\ndimension. The points themselves end up as leaves of the tree. Making the tree follows pretty much the \\nsame steps as usual for constructing a binary tre e: we identify a place to split into two choices, left and \\nright, and then carry on down the tree. This makes it natural to write the algorithm recursively. The \\nchoice of what to split and where is what makes the KD -tree special. Just one dimension is spli t in each \\nstep, and the position of the split is found by computing the median of the points that are to be split in \\nthat one dimension, and putting the line there. In general, the choice of which dimension to split'),\n",

However, it is not the only option, nor is it necessarily the most \\nuseful. In this section we will look at the underlying idea behind d istance calculations and possible \\nalternatives. \\n \\nIf I were to ask you to find the distance between my house and the nearest shop, then your first \\nguess might involve taking a map of my town, locating my house and the shop, and using a ruler to \\nmeasure the distance between them. By careful application of the map scale you can now tell me how \\nfar it is. However, when I set out to buy some milk I’m liable to find that I have to walk rather further \\nthan you’ve told me, since the direct line that you measured wo uld involve walking through (or over) \\nseveral houses, and some serious fence-scaling. Your ‘as the crow flies’ distance is the shortest possible \\npath, and it is the straight -line, or Euclidean, distance. You can measure it on the map by just using a \\nruler, but it essentially consists of measuring the distance in one direction (we’ll call it \\nnorth-south) and then the distance in another direction that is perpendicular to the first (let’s call it \\neast-west) and then squaring them, adding them together, and th en taking the square root of that. \\nWriting that out, the Euclidean distance that we are all used to is: \\n \\n \\nwhere (x1, y1) is the location of my house in some coordinate system (say by using a GPS tracker) and \\n(x2, y2) is the location of the shop. \\n \\nIf I told you that my town was laid out on a grid block system, as is common in towns that were \\nbuilt in the interval between the invention of the motor car and the invention of innovative town \\nplanners, then you would probably use a different measure. You woul d measure the distance between \\nmy house and the shop in the ‘north -south’ direction and the distance in the ‘east -west’ direction, and \\nthen add the two distances together. This would correspond to the distance I actually had to walk. It is \\noften known as the city-block or Manhattan distance and looks like: \\n \\nThe point of this discussion is to show that there is more than one way to measure a distance, \\nand that they can provide radically different answers. These two different distances can be seen in \\nFigure 11. Mathematically, these distance measures are known as metrics. A metric function or norm \\ntakes two inputs and gives a scalar (the distance) back, which is positive, and 0 if and only if the two \\npoints are the same, symmetric (so that the distance \\nto the  shop is the same as the distance back), and obeys the triangle inequality, which says that the \\ndistance from a to b plus the distance from b to c should not be less than the direct distance from a to c.'),\n",

In fact, these two measures are both instances of a class of metrics that \\nwork in any number of dimensions. The general measure is the Minkowski metric and it is written as: \\n \\n \\nIf we put k = 1 then we get the city -block distance (Equation (7.12)), and k = 2 gives the \\nEuclidean distance (Equation (7.11)). Thus, you might possibly see the Euclidean metric written as the L2 \\nnorm and the city -block distance as the L1 norm. These norms have another interesting feature. \\nRemember that we can define different ave rages of a set of numbers. If we define the average as the \\npoint that minimises the sum of the distance to every datapoint, then it turns out that the mean \\nminimises the Euclidean distance (the sum -of-squares distance), and the median minimises the L1 \\nmetric. \\n \\nThere are plenty of other possible metrics to choose, depending upon the dataspace. We \\ngenerally assume that the space is flat (if it isn’t, then none of these techniques work, and we don’t \\nwant to worry about that). However, it can still be beneficia l to look at other metrics. Suppose that we \\nwant our classifier to be able to recognise images, for example of faces. We take a set of digital photos \\nof faces and use the pixel values as features. Then we use the nearest neighbour algorithm that we’ve \\njust seen to identify each face. Even if we ensure that all of the photos are taken fully face -on, there are \\nstill a few things that will get in the way of this method. One is that slight variations in the angle of the \\nhead (or the camera) could make a differe nce; another is that different distances between the face and \\nthe camera (scaling) will change the results; and another is that different lighting conditions will make a \\ndifference. We can try to fix all of these things in preprocessing, but there is also another alternative: \\nuse a different metric that is invariant to these changes, i.e., it does not vary as they do. The idea of \\ninvariant metrics is to find measures that ignore changes that you don’t want. So if you want to be able \\nto rotate shapes around and still recognize them, you need a metric that is invariant to rotation. \\n \\nA common invariant metric in use for images is the tangent distance, which is an approximation \\nto the Taylor expansion in first derivatives, and works very well for small rotations  and scalings; for \\nexample, it was used to halve the final error rate on nearest neighbor classification of a set of \\nhandwritten letters. Invariant metrics are an interesting topic for further study, and there is a reference \\nfor them in the Further Reading section if you are interested.'),\n",

Introduction \\n\\uf0b7 Consider building a learning robot. The robot, or agent, has a set of sensors to observe the state of \\nits environment, and a set of actions it can perform to alter this state.  \\n\\uf0b7 Its task is to learn a control strategy, or policy, for choosing actions that achieve its goals.  \\n\\uf0b7 The goals of the agent can be defined by a reward function that assigns a numerical value to each \\ndistinct action the agent may take from each distinct state.  \\n\\uf0b7 This reward function may be built into the robot, or known only to an external teacher who \\nprovides the reward value for each action performed by the robot.  \\n\\uf0b7 The task of the robot is to perform sequences of actions, observe their consequences, and learn a \\ncontrol policy.  \\n\\uf0b7 The control policy is one that, from any initial state, chooses actions that maximize the reward \\naccumulated over time by the agent.  \\nExample:  \\n\\uf0b7 A mobile robot may have sensors such as a camera and sonars, and actions such as \"move \\nforward\" and \"turn.\"  \\n\\uf0b7 The robot may have a goal of docking onto its battery charger whenever its battery level is low.  \\n\\uf0b7 The goal of docking to the batt ery charger can be captured by assigning a positive reward (Eg., \\n+100) to state -action transitions that immediately result in a connection to the charger and a \\nreward of zero to every other state-action transition.  \\n \\nReinforcement Learning Problem  \\n\\uf0b7 An agent interacting with its environment. The agent exists in an environment described by some \\nset of possible states S.  \\n\\uf0b7 Agent perform any of a set of possible actions A. Each time it performs an action a, in some state st \\nthe agent receives a real -valued reward r, that indicates the immediate value of this state -action \\ntransition. This produces a sequence of states si, actions ai, and immediate rewards ri as shown in \\nthe figure.  \\n\\uf0b7 The agent\\'s task is to learn a control policy, 𝝅: S → A, that maximizes the expected sum of these \\nrewards, with future rewards discounted exponentially by their delay.'),\n",

Delayed reward: The task of the agent is to learn a target function 𝜋 that maps from the current state \\ns to the optimal action a = 𝜋 (s). In reinforcement learning, training information is not available in (s, 𝜋 \\n(s)). Instead, the trainer provides only a sequence of immediate reward values as the agent executes its \\nsequence of actions. The agen t, therefore, faces the problem of temporal credit assignment : \\ndetermining which of the actions in its sequence are to be credited with producing the eventual \\nrewards.  \\n \\n2. Exploration: In reinforcement learning, the agent influences the distribution of training examples by \\nthe action sequence it chooses. This raises the question of which experimentation strategy produces \\nmost effective learning. The learner faces a trade -off in choosing whether to favor exploration of \\nunknown states and actions, or exploitation of states and actions that it has already learned will yield \\nhigh reward.  \\n \\n3. Partially observable states: The agent's sensors can perceive the entire state of the environment at \\neach time step, in many practical situations sensors provide only partial information. In such cases, the \\nagent needs to consider its previous observations together with its current sensor data when choosing \\nactions, and the best policy may be one that cho oses actions specifically to improve the observability of \\nthe environment.  \\n \\n4. Life-long learning: Robot requires to learn several related tasks within the same environment, using \\nthe same sensors. For example, a mobile robot may need to learn how to dock  on its battery charger, \\nhow to navigate through narrow corridors, and how to pick up output from laser printers. This setting \\nraises the possibility of using previously obtained experience or knowledge to reduce sample complexity \\nwhen learning new tasks.  \\n \\n4.2. Learning Task \\n\\uf0b7 Consider Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent can perceive a set S of distinct states of \\nits environment and has a set A of actions that it can perform.  \\n\\uf0b7 At each discrete time step t, the agent senses the current state st , chooses a current action at, and \\nperforms it.\"),\n",

One approach is to require the policy that produces the greatest possible cumulative reward for the \\nrobot over time.  \\n\\uf0b7 To state this requirement more precisely, define the cumulative value Vπ (st) achieved by following \\nan arbitrary policy π from an arbitrary initial state st as follows:  \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Where, the sequence of rewards rt+i is generated by beginning at state st and by repeatedly using \\nthe policy π to select actions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Here 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is a constant that determines the relative value of delayed versus immediate \\nrewards. if we set γ = 0, only the immediate reward is considered.

Motivation \\nGenetic algorithms (GAS) provide a learning method motivated by an analogy to biological \\nevolution. Rather than search from general -to-specific hypotheses, or from simple -to-complex, GAS \\ngenerate successor hypotheses by repeatedly mutating and recombining parts of the best currently \\nknown hypotheses. At each step, a collection of hypotheses called the current population is updated by \\nreplacing some fraction of the population by offspring of the most fit current hypotheses. The process \\nforms a generate-and-test beam-search of hypotheses, in which variants of the best current hypotheses \\nare most likely to be considered next. The popularity of GAS is motivated by a number of factors \\nincluding: \\n\\uf0b7 Evolution is known to be a successful, robust method for adaptation within biological systems. \\n\\uf0b7 GAS can search spaces of hypotheses containing complex interacting parts, where the impact of \\neach part on overall hypothesis fitness may be difficult to model. \\n\\uf0b7 Genetic algorithms are easily parallelized and can take advantage of  the decreasing costs of \\npowerful computer hardware. \\n \\n9.2 Genetic Algorithms \\nThe problem addressed by GAS is to search a space of candidate hypotheses to identify the best \\nhypothesis. In GAS the \"best hypothesis\" is defined as the one that optimizes a pred efined numerical \\nmeasure for the problem at hand, called b the hypothesis fitness. For example, if the learning task is the \\nproblem of approximating an unknown function given training examples of its input and output, then \\nfitness could be defined as the accuracy of the hypothesis over this training data. If the task is to learn a \\nstrategy for playing chess, fitness could be defined as the number of games won by the individual when \\nplaying against other individuals in the current population. \\nAlthough different implementations of genetic algorithms vary in their details, they typically share the \\nfollowing structure: The algorithm operates by iteratively updating a pool of hypotheses, called the \\npopulation. On each iteration, all members of the population are evaluated according to the fitness \\nfunction. A new population is then generated by probabilistically selecting the fit individuals from the \\ncurrent population. Some of these selected individuals are carried forward into the next generation \\npopulation intact. Others are used as the basis for creating new offspring individuals by applying genetic \\noperations such as crossover and mutation.'),\n",

At this point, a certain fraction m of these members are chosen at \\nrandom, and random mutations all performed to alter these members. \\n \\n \\nThis GA algorithm thus performs a randomized, parallel beam search for hypothes es that perform well \\naccording to the fitness function. In the following subsections, we describe in more detail the \\nrepresentation of hypotheses and genetic operators used in this algorithm. \\n \\nRepresenting Hypotheses \\nHypotheses in GAS are often represented  by bit strings, so that they can be easily manipulated \\nby genetic operators such as mutation and crossover. The hypotheses represented by these bit strings \\ncan be quite complex. For example, sets of if -then rules can easily be represented in this way, by \\nchoosing an encoding of rules that allocates specific substrings for each rule precondition and \\npostcondition. \\nTo see how if -then rules can be encoded by bit strings, .first consider how we might use a bit \\nstring to describe a constraint on the value of a single attribute. To pick an example, consider the \\nattribute Outlook, which can take on any of the three values Sunny, Overcast, or Rain. One obvious way \\nto represent a constraint on Outlook is to use a bit string of length three, in which each bit position \\ncorresponds to one of its three possible values. Placing a 1 in some position indicates that the attribute \\nis allowed to take on the corresponding value. For example, the string 010 represe nts the constraint \\nthat Outlook must take on the second of these values, or Outlook = Overcast. Similarly, the string 011 \\nrepresents the more general constraint that allows two possible values, or (Outlook = Overcast v Rain). \\nNote 11 1 represents the most general possible constraint, indicating that we don\\'t care which of its \\npossible values the attribute takes on. \\nGiven this method for representing constraints on a single attribute, conjunctions of constraints \\non multiple attributes can easily be represent ed by concatenating the corresponding bit strings. For \\nexample, consider a second attribute, Wind, that can take on the value Strong or Weak. A rule \\nprecondition such as  \\n \\n(Outlook = Overcast ^Rain) A (Wind = Strong) \\n \\ncan then be represented by the following bit string of length five: \\n \\n    Outlook    Wind \\n01 1      10 \\n \\nRule postconditions (such as PlayTennis = yes) can be represented in a similar fashion. Thus, an entire \\nrule can be described by concatenating the bit strings describing the rule preconditions, together with \\nthe bit string describing the rule postcondition. For example, the rule \\n \\nIF Wind = Strong THEN PlayTennis = yes \\n \\nwould be represented by the string \\n \\n    Outlook    Wind    PlayTennis \\n111      10     10 \\n \\nwhere the first three bits describe the \"don\\'t care\" constraint on Outlook, the next two bits describe the \\nconstraint on Wind, and the final two bits describe the rule postcondition (here we assume PlayTennis'),\n",

Note the bit string representing the rule contains a substring for each \\nattribute in the hypothesis space, even if that attribute is not constrained by the rule preconditions. This \\nyields a fixed length bit-string representation for rules, in which substrings at speci fic locations describe \\nconstraints on specific attributes. Given this representation for single rules, we can represent sets of \\nrules by similarly concatenating the bit string representations of the individual rules. \\n \\n \\nIn designing a bit string encoding fo r some hypothesis space, it is useful to arrange for every \\nsyntactically legal bit string to represent a well -defined hypothesis. To illustrate, note in the rule \\nencoding in the above paragraph the bit string 11 1 10 11 represents a rule whose postconditio n does \\nnot constrain the target attribute PlayTennis. If we wish to avoid considering this hypothesis, we may \\nemploy a different encoding (e.g., allocate just one bit to the PlayTennis postcondition to indicate \\nwhether the value is Yes or No), alter the ge netic operators so that they explicitly avoid constructing \\nsuch bit strings, or simply assign a very low fitness to such bit strings. \\n \\nIn some GAS, hypotheses are represented by symbolic descriptions rather than bit strings.  \\n \\nGenetic Operators \\nThe generation of successors in a GA is determined by a set of operators that recombine and \\nmutate selected members of the current population. These operators correspond to idealized versions \\nof the genetic operations found in biological evolution. The two most common operators are crossover \\nand mutation. \\nThe crossover operator produces two new offspring from two parent strings, by copying \\nselected bits from each parent. The bit at position i in each offspring is copied from the bit at position i \\nin one of the two parents. The choice of which parent contributes the bit for position i is determined by \\nan additional string called the crossover mask. To illustrate, consider the single-point crossover \\noperator at the top of Table Consider the topmost of the two offspring i n this case. This offspring takes \\nits first five bits from the first parent and its remaining six bits from the second parent, because the \\ncrossover mask 11 11 1000000 specifies these choices for each of the bit positions. The second offspring \\nuses the same crossover mask, but switches the roles of the two parents. Therefore, it contains the bits \\nthat were not used by the first offspring. In single -point crossover, the crossover mask is always \\nconstructed so that it begins with a string containing n contiguous Is, followed by the necessary number \\nof 0s to complete the string. This results in offspring in which the first n bits are contributed by one \\nparent and the remaining bits by the second parent. Each time the single -point crossover operator is \\napplied the crossover point n is chosen at random, and the crossover mask is then created and applied.'),\n",

Put another way, the crossover mask is a string beginning with \\nno zeros, followed by a contiguous string of nl ones, followed by the nece ssary number of zeros to \\ncomplete the string. Each time the two -point crossover operator is applied, a mask is generated by \\nrandomly choosing the integers no and nl.  \\n \\nFitness Function and Selection \\nThe fitness function defines the criterion for ranking po tential hypotheses and for \\nprobabilistically selecting them for inclusion in the next generation population. If the task is to learn \\nclassification rules, then the fitness function typically has a component that scores the classification \\naccuracy of the ru le over a set of provided training examples. Often other criteria may be included as \\nwell, such as the complexity or generality of the rule. More generally, when the bit -string hypothesis is \\ninterpreted as a complex procedure (e.g., when the bit string represents a collection of if-then rules that \\nwill be chained together to control a robotic device), the fitness function may measure the overall \\nperformance of the resulting procedure rather than performance of individual rules. \\nIn our prototypical GA shown in above Table , the probability that a hypothesis will be selected is given \\nby the ratio of its fitness to the fitness of other members of the current population as seen in Equation \\nabove . This method is sometimes called fitness proportionate selection, or roulette wheel selection. \\nOther methods for using fitness to select hypotheses have also been proposed. For example, in \\ntournament selection, two hypotheses are first chosen at random from the current population. With \\nsome predefined probability p the more fit of these two is then selected, and with probability (1 - p) the \\nless fit hypothesis is selected. Tournament selection often yields a more diverse population than fitness \\nproportionate selection. In another method called rank selection, the hypothes es in the current \\npopulation are first sorted by fitness. The probability that a hypothesis will be selected is then \\nproportional to its rank in this sorted list, rather than its fitness.'),\n",

An Illustrative Example \\nA genetic algorithm can be viewed as a general optimization method that searches a large space \\nof candidate objects seeking one that performs best according to the fitness function. Although not \\nguaranteed to find an optimal object, GAS often succeed in finding an object with high fitness. GAS have \\nbeen applied to a number of optimization problems outside machine learning, including problems such \\nas circuit layout and job -shop scheduling. Within machine learning, they have been applied both to \\nfunction-approximation problems and to tasks such a s choosing the network topology for artificial \\nneural network learning systems. \\nTo illustrate the use of GAS for concept learning, we briefly summarize the GABIL system \\ndescribed by DeJong et al. (1993). GABIL uses a GA to learn boolean concepts represente d by a \\ndisjunctive set of propositional rules. In experiments over several concept learning problems, GABIL was \\nfound to be roughly comparable in generalization accuracy to other learning algorithms such as the \\ndecision tree learning algorithm C4.5 and the rule learning system AQ14. The learning tasks in this study \\nincluded both artificial learning tasks designed to explore the systems' generalization accuracy and the \\nreal world problem of breast cancer diagnosis. \\nThe specific instantiation of the GA algorithm in GABIL can be summarized as follows: \\nRepresentation. Each hypothesis in GABIL corresponds to a disjunctive set of propositional rules, \\nencoded as described in Section 9.2.1. In particular, the hypothesis space of rule preconditions consists \\nof a conj unction of constraints on a fixed set of attributes, as described in that earlier section. To \\nrepresent a set of rules, the bit-string representations of individual rules are concatenated. To illustrate, \\nconsider a hypothesis space in which rule preconditi ons are conjunctions of constraints over two \\nBoolean attributes, a1 and a2.The rule postcondition is described by a single bit that indicates the \\npredicted value of the target attribute c. Thus, the hypothesis consisting of the two rules \\n \\nIF al=T^a2=F THEN c=T; IF a2=T THEN c=F \\n \\n \\nwould be represented by the string \\n \\na1   a2   c   a1   a2   c \\n10  01  1 11  01 0 \\n \\nNote the length of the bit string grows with the number of rules in the hypothesis. This variable bit -\\nstring length requires a slight modification to the crossover operator, as described below. \\n \\nGenetic operators. GABIL uses the standard mutation operator of  above Table in which a single \\nbit is chosen at random and replaced by its complement. The crossover operator that it uses is a fairly \\nstandard extension to the two -point crossover operator described in Table 9.2. In particular, to \\naccommodate the variable-length bit strings that encode rule sets, and to constrain the system so that \\ncrossover occurs only between like sections of the bit strings that encode rules, the following approach \\nis taken. To perform a crossover operation on two parents, two crossover point s are first chosen at \\nrandom in the first parent string. Let dl (dz) denote the distance from the leftmost (rightmost) of these \\ntwo crossover points to the rule boundary immediately to its left. The crossover points in the second \\nparent are now randomly ch osen, subject to the constraint that they must have the same dl and d2 \\nvalue. For example, if the two parent strings are\"),\n",

These two new bits define part of the search \\nstrategy used by the GA and are themselves altered and evolved using the same crossover and mutation \\noperators that operate on other bits in the string. While the authors report m ixed results with this \\napproach (i.e., improved performance on some problems, decreased performance on others), it \\nprovides an interesting illustration of how GAS might in principle be used to evolve their own \\nhypothesis search methods. \\n \\n5.4 Hypothesis Space Search \\nAs illustrated above, GAS employ a randomized beam search method to seek a maximally fit hypothesis. \\nThis search is quite different from that of other learning methods we have considered in this book. To \\ncontrast the hypothesis space search of GA S with that of neural network BACKPROPAGATION, for \\nexample, the radiant descent search in BACKPROPAGATION moves smoothly from one hypothesis to a \\nnew hypothesis that is very similar. In contrast, the GA search can move much more abruptly, replacing \\na parent hypothesis by an offspring that may be radically different from the parent. Note the GA search \\nis therefore less likely to fall into the same kind of local minima that can plague gradient descent \\nmethods.  \\nOne practical difficulty in some GA applications is the problem of crowding. Crowding is a phenomenon \\nin which some individual that is more highly fit than others in the population quickly reproduces, so that \\ncopies of this individual and very similar individuals take over a large fraction of the popula tion. The \\nnegative impact of crowding is that it reduces the diversity of the population, thereby slowing further \\nprogress by the GA. Several strategies have been explored for reducing crowding. One approach is to \\nalter the selection function, using criter ia such as tournament selection or rank selection in place of \\nfitness proportionate roulette wheel selection. A related strategy is \"fitness sharing,\" in which the \\nmeasured fitness of an individual is reduced by the presence of other, similar individuals i n the \\npopulation. A third approach is to restrict the kinds of individuals allowed to recombine to form \\noffspring. For example, by allowing only the most similar individuals to recombine, we can encourage'),\n",

A related \\napproach is to spatially distribute individuals and allow only nearby individuals to recombine. Many of \\nthese techniques are inspired by the analogy to biological evolution. \\n \\nPopulation Evolution and the Schema Theorem \\nIt is interesting to ask whether one can mathematically characterize the evolution over time of the \\npopulation within a GA. The schema theorem provides one such characterization. It is based on the \\nconcept of schemas, or patterns that d escribe sets of bit strings. To be precise, a schema is any string \\ncomposed of 0s, 1s, and *\\'s. Each schema represents the set of bit strings containing the indicated 0s \\nand 1s, with each “*” interpreted as a \"don\\'t care.\" For example, the schema 0*10 repr esents the set of \\nbit strings that includes exactly 0010 and 01 10. \\nAn individual bit string can be viewed as a representative of each of the different schemas that it \\nmatches. For example, the bit string 0010 can be thought of as a representative of 2 4 distinct schemas \\nincluding 00**, 0* 10, ****, etc. Similarly, a population of bit strings can be viewed in terms of the set \\nof schemas that it represents and the number of individuals associated with each of these schema.  \\nThe schema theorem characterizes the evolution of the population within a GA in terms of the number \\nof instances representing each schema. Let m(s, t) denote the number of instances of schema s in the \\npopulation at time t (i.e., during the t th generation). The schema theorem describes the e xpected value \\nof m(s,t+1) in terms of m(s, t) and other properties of the schema, population, and GA algorithm \\nparameters. \\nThe evolution of the population in the GA depends on the selection step, the recombination step, and \\nthe mutation step. Let us start by considering just the effect of the selection step. Let f (h) denote the \\nfitness of the individual bit string h and \\n\\uf028 \\uf029tf\\n\\uf04b denote the average fitness of all individuals in the \\npopulation at time t. Let n be the total number of individuals in the population. Let \\npt\\nsh \\uf0c7\\uf065 , indicate \\nthat the individual h is both a representative of schema s and a me mber of the population at time t. \\nFinally, let \\n\\uf028 \\uf029tsu ,\\n\\uf0d9 denote the average fitness of instances of schema s in the population at time t. \\nWe are interested in calculating the expected value of m(s,t+1), which we denote E[m(s,t+1)]. We can \\ncalculate E[m(s,t+1)] using the probability distribution for selection given in Equation, which can be \\nrestated using our current terminology as follows \\n \\nNow if we select one member for the new population according to this probability distribution, then the \\nprobability that we will select a representative of schema s is'),\n",

Therefore, the expected number of instances of s resulting from the n independent selection steps \\nthat create the entire new generation is just n times this probability. \\n \\n \\n \\nEquation states that the expected number of instances of schema s at generation t+1 is proportional to \\nthe average fitness \\n\\uf028 \\uf029tsu ,\\n\\uf0d9  of instances of this schema at time t , and inversely proportional to the \\naverage fitness \\n\\uf028 \\uf029tf\\n\\uf04b  of all members of the population at time t. Thus, we can expect schemas with \\nabove average fitness to be represented with increasing frequency on successive generations. If we \\nview the GA as performing a virtual parallel search through the space of possibl e schemas at the same \\ntime it performs its explicit parallel search through the space of individuals, then Equation indicates that \\nmore fit schemas will grow in influence over time.  \\nWhile the above analysis considered only the selection step of the GA, the crossover and mutation \\nsteps must be considered as well. The schema theorem considers only the possible negative influence \\nof these genetic operators (e.g., random mutation may decrease the number of representatives of s, \\nindependent of \\n\\uf028 \\uf029tsu ,\\n\\uf0d9  and considers only the case of single -point crossover. The full schema theorem \\nthus provides a lower bound on the expected frequency of schema s, as follows: \\n \\n \\nHere, pc is the probability that the single-point crossover operator will be applied \\nto an arbitrary individual, and pm, is the probability that an arbitrary bit of an arbitrary individual will be \\nmutated by the mutation operator. o(s) is the number of defined bits in schema s, where 0 and 1 are \\ndefined bits, but * is not. d(s) is the distan ce between the leftmost and rightmost defined bits in s. \\nFinally, l is the length of the individual bit strings in the population. Notice the leftmost term in Equation \\nis identical to the term from Equation and describes the effect of the selection step. T he middle term \\ndescribes the effect of the single-point crossover operator-in particular, it describes the probability that \\nan arbitrary individual representing s will still represent s following application of this crossover \\noperator. The rightmost term describes the probability that an arbitrary individual representing schema \\ns will still represent schema s following application of the mutation operator. Note that the effects of \\nsingle-point crossover and mutation increase with the number of defined bits o(s) in the schema and \\nwith the distance d(s) between the defined bits. Thus, the schema theorem can be roughly interpreted \\nas stating that more fit schemas will tend to grow in influence, especially schemas containing a small \\nnumber of defined bits (i.e.,  containing a large number of *'s), and especially when these defined bits\"),\n",

The schema theorem is perhaps the most widely cited \\ncharacterization of population evolution within a GA. One way in which it is incomple te is that it fails to \\nconsider the (presumably) positive effects of crossover and mutation. Numerous more recent \\ntheoretical analyses have been proposed, including analyses based on Markov chain models and on \\nstatistical mechanics models. \\n \\n5.5 GENETIC PROGRAMMING \\nGenetic programming (GP) is a form of evolutionary computation in which the individuals in the \\nevolving population are computer programs rather than bit strings. The basic genetic programming \\napproach and presents a broad range of simple programs that can be successfully learned by GP.  \\n \\nRepresenting Programs \\nPrograms manipulated by a GP are typically represented by trees corresponding to the parse tree of the \\nprogram. Each function call is represented by a node in the tree, and the arguments to the functio n are \\ngiven by its descendant nodes. For example, below Figure illustrates this tree representation for the \\nfunction sin(x) +\\n\\uf028 \\uf029yx \\uf02b\\n2 . To apply genetic programming to a particular domain, the user must define \\nthe primitive functions to be con sidered (e.g., sin, cos, \\n , +, -, exponential~), as well as the terminals \\n(e.g., x, y, constants such as 2). The genetic programming algorithm then uses an evolutionary search to \\nexplore the vast space of programs that can be described  using these primitives. As in a genetic \\nalgorithm, the prototypical genetic programming algorithm maintains a population of individuals (in this \\ncase, program trees). On each iteration, it produces a new generation of individuals using selection, \\ncrossover, and mutation. The fitness of a given individual program in the population is typically \\ndetermined by executing the program on a set of training data. Crossover operations are performed by \\nreplacing a randomly chosen subtree of one parent program by a su btree from the other parent \\nprogram.'),\n",

T he remainder of \\nthe new generation is created by applying crossover to pairs of programs from the current generation, \\nagain selected probabilistically according to their fitness. The mutation operator was not used in this \\nparticular set of experiments. \\n \\nIllustrative Example \\nOne illustrative example presented by Koza (1992) involves learning an algorithm for stacking the blocks \\nshown in below Figure The task is to develop a general algorithm for stacking the blocks into a single \\nstack that spells the word \"universal,\" independent of the initial configuration of blocks in the world. \\nThe actions available for manipulating blocks allow moving only a single block at a time. In particular, \\nthe top block on the stack can be moved to the table surface, or a block on the table surface can be \\nmoved to the top of the stack.'),\n",

In Koza\\'s formulation, the primitive functions used to compose prog rams \\nfor this task include the following three terminal arguments: \\n\\uf0b7 CS (current stack), which refers to the name of the top block on the stack, or F if there is no \\ncurrent stack. \\n\\uf0b7 TB (top correct block), which refers to the name of the topmost block on the s tack, such that it \\nand those blocks beneath it are in the correct order. \\n\\uf0b7 NN (next necessary), which refers to the name of the next block needed above TB in the stack, \\nin order to spell the word \"universal,\" or F if no more blocks are needed.  \\n \\nAs can be se en, this particular choice of terminal arguments provides a natural representation for \\ndescribing programs for manipulating blocks for this task. Imagine, in contrast, the relative difficulty of \\nthe task if we were to instead define the terminal arguments to be the x and y coordinates of each \\nblock. \\nIn addition to these terminal arguments, the program language in this application included the \\nfollowing primitive functions:  \\n\\uf0b7 (MS x) (move to stack), if block x is on the table, this operator moves x to the top  of the stack \\nand returns the value T. Otherwise, it does nothing and returns the value F. \\n\\uf0b7 (MT x) (move to table), if block x is somewhere in the stack, this moves the block at the top of \\nthe stack to the table and returns the value T. Otherwise, it returns the value F. \\n\\uf0b7 (EQ x y) (equal), which returns T if x equals y, and returns F otherwise. \\n\\uf0b7 (NOT x), which returns T if x = F, and returns F if x = T. \\n\\uf0b7 (DU x y) (do until), which executes the expression x repeatedly until expressiony returns the \\nvalue T. \\n \\nTo allow the system to evaluate the fitness of any given program, Koza provided a set of 166 training \\nexample problems representing a broad variety of initial block configurations, including problems of \\ndiffering degrees of difficulty. The fitness of any given  program was taken to be the number of these \\nexamples solved by the algorithm. The population was initialized to a set of 300 random programs. \\nAfter 10 generations, the system discovered the following program, which solves all 166 problems. \\n \\n(EQ (DU (MT CS)(NOT CS)) (DU (MS NN)(NOT NN)) ) \\n \\nNotice this program contains a sequence of two DU, or \"Do Until\" statements.

The second \"Do \\nUntil\" statement then repe atedly moves the next necessary block from the table onto the stack. The \\nrole played by the top level EQ expression here is to provide a syntactically legal way to sequence these \\ntwo \"Do Until\" loops. \\nSomewhat surprisingly, after only a few generations, this GP was able to discover a program that solves \\nall 166 training problems. Of course the ability of the system to accomplish this depends strongly on the \\nprimitive arguments and functions provided, and on the set of training example cases used to evaluate  \\nfitness. \\n \\nRemarks on Genetic Programming \\nAs illustrated in the above example, genetic programming extends genetic algorithms to the \\nevolution of complete computer programs. Despite the huge size of the hypothesis space it must \\nsearch, genetic programming has been demonstrated to produce intriguin g results in a number of \\napplications. A comparison of GP to other methods for searching through the space of computer \\nprograms, such as hillclimbing and simulated annealing, is given by O\\'Reilly and Oppacher (1994). \\nWhile the above example of GP search is  fairly simple, Koza et al. (1996) summarize the use of a GP in \\nseveral more complex tasks such as designing electronic filter circuits and classifying segments of \\nprotein molecules. The filter circuit design problem provides an example of a considerably m ore \\ncomplex problem. Here, programs are evolved that transform a simple fixed seed circuit into a final \\ncircuit design. The primitive functions used by the GP to construct its programs are functions that edit \\nthe seed circuit by inserting or deleting circu it components and wiring connections. The fitness of each \\nprogram is calculated by simulating the circuit it outputs (using the SPICE circuit simulator) to determine \\nhow closely this circuit meets the design specifications for the desired filter. More prec isely, the fitness \\nscore is the sum of the magnitudes of errors between the desired and actual circuit output at 101 \\ndifferent input frequencies. In this case, a population of size 640,000 was maintained, with selection \\nproducing 10% of the successor popul ation, crossover producing 89%, and mutation producing 1%. The \\nsystem was executed on a 64 -node parallel processor. Within the first randomly generated population, \\nthe circuits produced were so unreasonable that the SPICE simulator could not even simulate the \\nbehavior of 98% of the circuits. The percentage of unsimulatable circuits dropped to 84.9% following \\nthe first generation, to 75.0% following the second generation, and to an average of 9.6% over \\nsucceeding generations. The fitness score of the best circuit in the initial population was 159, compared \\nto a score of 39 after 20 generations and a score of 0.8 after 137 generations. The best circuit, produced \\nafter 137 generations, exhibited performance very similar to the desired behavior. \\nIn most cases, t he performance of genetic programming depends crucially on the choice of \\nrepresentation and on the choice of fitness function. For this reason, an active area of current research \\nis aimed at the automatic discovery and incorporation of subroutines that improve on the original set of \\nprimitive functions, thereby allowing the system to dynamically alter the primitives from which it \\nconstructs individuals. See, for example, Koza (1994). \\n \\n5.6 Models of Evolution and Learning \\nIn many natural systems, individual organisms learn to adapt significantly during their lifetime. \\nAt the same time, biological and social processes allow their species to adapt over a time frame of many \\ngenerations. One interesting question regarding evolutionary systems is \"What is the rela tionship \\nbetween learning during the lifetime of a single individual, and the longer time frame species -level \\nlearning afforded by evolution?\\' \\n \\nLamarckian Evolution \\nLarnarck was a scientist who, in the late nineteenth century, proposed that evolution over many \\ngenerations was directly influenced by the experiences of individual organisms during their lifetime.

This is an \\nattractive conjecture, because it would presumably allow for more efficient evolutionary pro gress than \\na generate -and-test process (like that of GAS and GPs) that ignores the experience gained during an \\nindividual\\'s lifetime. Despite the attractiveness of this theory, current scientific evidence \\noverwhelmingly contradicts Lamarck\\'s model. The cur rently accepted view is that the genetic makeup \\nof an individual is, in fact, unaffected by the lifetime experience of one\\'s biological parents. Despite this \\napparent biological fact, recent computer studies have shown that Lamarckian processes can \\nsometimes improve the effectiveness of computerized genetic algorithms (see Grefenstette 1991; \\nAckley and Littman 1994; and Hart and Belew 1995). \\n \\nBaldwin Effect \\nAlthough Lamarckian evolution is not an accepted model of biological evolution, other mechanisms \\nhave been suggested by which individual learning can alter the course of evolution. One such \\nmechanism is called the Baldwin effect, after J. M. Baldwin (1896), who first suggested the idea. The \\nBaldwin effect is based on the following observations: \\n\\uf0b7 If a species is evolving in a changing environment, there will be evolutionary pressure to favor \\nindividuals with the capability to learn during their lifetime. For example, if a new predator \\nappears in the environment, then individuals capable of learning  to avoid the predator will be \\nmore successful than individuals who cannot learn. In effect, the ability to learn allows an \\nindividual to perform a small local search during its lifetime to maximize its fitness. In contrast, \\nnonlearning individuals whose f itness is fully determined by their genetic makeup will operate \\nat a relative disadvantage. \\n\\uf0b7 Those individuals who are able to learn many traits will rely less strongly on their genetic code \\nto \"hard-wire\" traits. As a result, these individuals can support a more diverse gene pool, relying \\non individual learning to overcome the \"missing\" or \"not quite optimized\" traits in the genetic \\ncode. This more diverse gene pool can, in turn, support more rapid evolutionary adaptation. \\nThus, the ability of individuals t o learn can have an indirect accelerating effect on the rate of \\nevolutionary adaptation for the entire population. \\n \\nTo illustrate, imagine some new change in the environment of some species, such as a new \\npredator. Such a change will selectively favor indi viduals capable of learning to avoid the predator. As \\nthe proportion of such self-improving individuals in the population grows, the population will be able to \\nsupport a more diverse gene pool, allowing evolutionary processes (even non -Lamarckian generate -\\nand-test processes) to adapt more rapidly. This accelerated adaptation may in turn enable standard \\nevolutionary processes to more quickly evolve a genetic (nonlearned) trait to avoid the predator (e.g., \\nan instinctive fear of this animal). Thus, the Baldwi n effect provides an indirect mechanism for \\nindividual learning to positively impact the rate of evolutionary progress. By increasing survivability and \\ngenetic diversity of the species, individual learning supports more rapid evolutionary progress, thereby  \\nincreasing the chance that the species will evolve genetic, nonlearned traits that better fit the new \\nenvironment.  \\nThere have been several attempts to develop computational models to study the Baldwin \\neffect. For example, Hinton and Nowlan (1987) experim ented with evolving a population of simple \\nneural networks, in which some network weights were fixed during the individual network \"lifetime,\" \\nwhile others were trainable. The genetic makeup of the individual determined which weights were'),\n",

In their experiments, when no individual learning was allowed, the \\npopulation failed to improve its fitness over time. However, when individual learning was allowed, the \\npopulation quickly improved its fitness. During early generations of ev olution the population contained \\na greater proportion of individuals with many trainable weights. However, as evolution proceeded, the \\nnumber of fixed, correct network weights tended to increase, as the population evolved toward \\ngenetically given weight va lues and toward less dependence on individual learning of weights. \\nAdditional computational studies of the Baldwin effect have been reported by Belew (1990), Harvey \\n(1993), and French and Messinger (1994). An excellent overview of this topic can be found i n Mitchell \\n(1996). A special issue of the journal Evolutionary Computation on this topic (Turney et al. 1997) \\ncontains several articles on the Baldwin effect. \\n \\n5.7 Parallelizing Genetic Algorithms \\nGAS are naturally suited to parallel implementation, and a number of approaches to \\nparallelization have been explored. Coarse grain approaches to parallelization subdivide the population \\ninto somewhat distinct groups of individuals, called demes. Each deme is assigned to a different \\ncomputational node, and a stand ard GA search is performed at each node. Communication and cross -\\nfertilization between demes occurs on a less frequent basis than within demes. Transfer between \\ndemes occurs by a migration process, in which individuals from one deme are copied or transferr ed to \\nother demes. This process is modeled after the kind of cross -fertilization that might occur between \\nphysically separated subpopulations of biological species. One benefit of such approaches is that it \\nreduces the crowding problem often encountered in  nonparallel GAS, in which the system falls into a \\nlocal optimum due to the early appearance of a genotype that comes to dominate the entire \\npopulation. Examples of coarse -grained parallel GAS are described by Tanese (1989) and by Cohoon et \\nal. (1987). \\nIn contrast to coarse -grained parallel implementations of GAS, fine -grained implementations \\ntypically assign one processor per individual in the population. Recombination then takes place among \\nneighboring individuals. Several different types of neighborhoods  have been proposed, ranging from \\nplanar grid to torus. Examples of such systems are described by Spiessens and Manderick (1991). An \\nedited collection of papers on parallel GAS is available in Stender (1993).')]"

They are important to ANNs \\nbecause they provide the basis for learning networks of many units. \\nOne way to learn an acceptable weight vector is to begin with random weights, then iteratively \\napply the perceptron to each training example, modifying the perceptron weights whenever it \\nmisclassifies an example. This process is repeated, iterating through the training examples as many \\ntimes as needed until \\nthe perceptron classifies all training examples correctly.

It is usually set to some small value \\n(e.g., 0.1) and is sometimes made to decay as the number of weight-tuning iterations increases. \\nWhy should this update rule converge toward successful weight values? To get an intuitive feel, \\nconsider some specific cases. Suppose the training example is cor rectly classified already by the \\nperceptron. In this case, (t - o) is zero, making \\nwi\\uf044  zero, so that no weights are updated. Suppose the \\nperceptron outputs a -1, when the target output is +1. To make the perceptron output a+1 instead of -1 \\nin this case, the weights must be altered to increase the value of \\n\\uf0ae\\uf0ae\\nxw.  For example, if xi>0, then \\nincreasing wi will bring the perceptron closer to correctly classifying this example. Notice the training \\nrule will increase w, in this case, because (t - o),',\n",

On the \\nother hand, if t = -1 and o = 1, then weights associated with positive xi will be decreased rather than \\nincreased. \\n \\nIn fact, the above learning procedure can be proven to converge within a finite number of applications \\nof the perceptron training rule to a weight vector that correctly classifies all training examples, provided \\nthe training examples are linearly separable and provided a sufficiently small \\n\\uf068  is used.

The \\nBaldwin effect is based on the following observations: \\n\\uf0b7 If a species is evolving in a changing environment, there will be evolutionary pressure to favor \\nindividuals with the capability to learn during their lifetime.

In contrast, \\nnonlearning individuals whose f itness is fully determined by their genetic makeup will operate \\nat a relative disadvantage. \\n\\uf0b7 Those individuals who are able to learn many traits will rely less strongly on their genetic code \\nto \"hard-wire\" traits. As a result, these individuals can support a more diverse gene pool, relying \\non individual learning to overcome the \"missing\" or \"not quite optimized\" traits in the genetic \\ncode.
